	---help---
	  Enable the suspend to disk (STD) functionality, which is usually
	  called "hibernation" in user interfaces.  STD checkpoints the
	  system and powers it off; and restores that checkpoint on reboot.

	  You can suspend your machine with 'echo disk > /sys/power/state'
	  after placing resume=/dev/swappartition on the kernel command line
	  in your bootloader's configuration file.

	  Alternatively, you can use the additional userland tools available
	  from <http://suspend.sf.net>.

	  In principle it does not require ACPI or APM, although for example
	  ACPI will be used for the final steps when it is available.  One
	  of the reasons to use software suspend is that the firmware hooks
	  for suspend states like suspend-to-RAM (STR) often don't work very
	  well with Linux.

	  It creates an image which is saved in your active swap. Upon the next
	  boot, pass the 'resume=/dev/swappartition' argument to the kernel to
	  have it detect the saved image, restore memory state from it, and
	  continue to run as before. If you do not want the previous state to
	  be reloaded, then use the 'noresume' kernel command line argument.
	  Note, however, that fsck will be run on your filesystems and you will
	  need to run mkswap against the swap partition used for the suspend.

	  It also works with swap files to a limited extent (for details see
	  <file:Documentation/power/swsusp-and-swap-files.txt>).

	  Right now you may boot without resuming and resume later but in the
	  meantime you cannot use the swap partition(s)/file(s) involved in
	  suspending.  Also in this case you must not use the filesystems
	  that were mounted before the suspend.  In particular, you MUST NOT
	  MOUNT any journaled filesystems mounted before the suspend or they
	  will get corrupted in a nasty way.

	  For more information take a look at <file:Documentation/power/swsusp.txt>.

	  The partition specified can be overridden by specifying:

		resume=/dev/<other device> 

	  which will set the resume partition to the device specified. 

	  Note there is currently not a way to specify which device to save the

		---help---
		  This option allows you to keep and image and reuse it. It is intended

		  only (kiosks, for example). To use it, compile this option in and boot
		  normally. Set the KEEP_IMAGE flag in /sys/power/tuxonice and suspend.
		  When you resume, the image will not be removed. You will be unable to turn
		  off swap partitions (assuming you are using the swap allocator), but future
		  suspends simply do a power-down. The image can be updated using the
		  kernel command line parameter suspend_act= to turn off the keep image
		  bit. Keep image mode is a little less user friendly on purpose - it

	config TOI_REPLACE_SWSUSP

		  TuxOnIce can replace swsusp. This option makes that the default state,

		  to use the vanilla kernel functionality. Note that your initrd/ramfs will
		  need to do this before trying to resume, too.
		  With overriding swsusp enabled, echoing disk  to /sys/power/state will
		  start a TuxOnIce cycle. If resume= doesn't specify an allocator and both

	config TOI_IGNORE_LATE_INITCALL

		---help---
		  When booting, TuxOnIce can check for an image and start to resume prior

		  If you don't have an initrd/ramfs, this is what you want to happen -
		  otherwise you won't be able to safely resume. You should set this option
		  to 'No'.

		  If, however, you want your initrd/ramfs to run anyway before resuming,
		  you need to tell TuxOnIce to ignore that earlier opportunity to resume.
		  This can be done either by using this compile time option, or by
		  overriding this option with the boot-time parameter toi_initramfs_resume_only=1.

		  Note that if TuxOnIce can't resume at the earlier opportunity, the
		  value of this option won't matter - the initramfs/initrd (if any) will

		  TuxOnIce can display warnings very early in the process of resuming,
		  if (for example) it appears that you have booted a kernel that doesn't
		  match an image on disk. It can then give you the opportunity to either
		  continue booting that kernel, or reboot the machine. This option can be
		  used to control how long to wait in such circumstances. -1 means wait
		  forever. 0 means don't wait at all (do the default action, which will
		  generally be to continue booting and remove the image). Values of 1 or
		  more indicate a number of seconds (up to 255) to wait before doing the

		  This value controls the default for the allowance TuxOnIce makes for
		  drivers to allocate extra memory during the atomic copy. The default
		  value of 2000 will be okay in most cases. If you are using
		  DRI, the easiest way to find what value to use is to try to hibernate
		  and look at how many pages were actually needed in the sysfs entry
		  /sys/power/tuxonice/debug_info (first number on the last line), adding
		  a little extra because the value is not always the same.

		  when there's no other activity, we need this to check for pages that have

		  always says no pages were resaved, you may be able to safely disable this

	  notification of APM "events" (e.g. battery status change).

	  In order to use APM, you will need supporting software. For location
	  and more information, read <file:Documentation/power/apm-acpi.txt>
	  and the Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)

	  Generally, if you don't have a battery in your machine, there isn't
