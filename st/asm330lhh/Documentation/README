	Android STMicroelectronics SensorHAL Documentation

In order to correctly use Android SensorHAL, modifications at Android code
are necessaries.

Linux device drivers permissions:
	First at all, SensorHAL needs to read/write sysfs files and char devices
	of IIO drivers.
	device/{vendor}/{product}/uevent.{board}.rc file modification is mandatory,
	you can find an example in this folder with 'uevent.example.rc'.

Factory calibration option:
	If you build the HAL using Factory calibration option, modifications of
	SELinux policy are necessary in order to read/write /persist and
	/data filesystem.
	You can find an example of modifications into the folder factory_calibration.
	Those modifications will touch:
		- device/{vendor}/{product}/BoardConfig.mk (modification)
		- device/{vendor}/{product}/init.{board}.rc (modification)
		- device/{vendor}/{product}/sepolicy/file.te (modification)
		- device/{vendor}/{product}/sepolicy/file_contexts (modification)
		- device/{vendor}/{product}/sepolicy/STSensors.te (add)

Selftest tool manual:
	If you build HAL enabling Selftest functions, an executable will be
	available and installed into /system/bin/STSensor_selftest.
	Using this binaty you will be able to execute easly selftest,
	based only on Android sensor handle. No information about device
	driver will be used.
	You can run binary directly in your device using adb shell. All sensors
	must be switched off in order to execute the test.
