/**
 * There are four request types that are applicable for rpmb accesses- two
 * under read category and two under write. They are
 *
 *  Reads
 *  -------
 *  1. Read Write Counter
 *  2. Authenticated data read
 *
 *
 *  Writes
 *  -------
 *  1. Provision RPMB key (though it might be done in a secure environment)
 *  2. Authenticated data write
 *
 *  While its given that the rpmb data frames are going to have that
 *  information encoded in it and the frames should be generated by a secure
 *  piece of code, the request types can be classified as above.
 *
 *  So here are the set of commands that should be executed atomically in the
 *  ioctl for rpmb read operation
 *  1. Switch partition
 *  2. Set block count
 *  3. Write data frame - CMD25 to write the rpmb data frame
 *  4. Set block count
 *  5. Read the data - CMD18 to do the actual read
 *
 *  Similarly for rpmb write operation, these are the commands that should be
 *  executed atomically in the ioctl for rpmb write operation
 *  1. Switch partition
 *  2. Set block count
 *  3. Write data frame - CMD25 to write the rpmb data frame with data
 *  4. Set block count
 *  5. Read the data - CMD25 to write rpmb data frame indicating that rpmb
 *     result register is about to be read
 *  6. Set block count
 *  7. Read rpmb result - CMD18 to read the rpmb result register
 *
 * Each of the above commands should be sent individually via struct mmc_ioc_cmd
 * and fields like is_acmd that are not needed for rpmb operations will be
 * ignored.
