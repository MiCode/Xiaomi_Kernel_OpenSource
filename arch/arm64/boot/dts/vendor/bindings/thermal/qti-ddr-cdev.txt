QTI DDR cooling device.

The DDR cooling device will be used to place a DDR frequency vote. This
cooling device will be used in those cases where all the subsystem's are
thermally throttled and DDR has to be operated with a minimum performance
level. This cooling device vote can ensure the same.

Properties:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,ddr-cooling-device"

Cooling device node:
- qcom,ddr-freq:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32 array>
	Definition: List of available DDR frequencies.

-#cooling-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <integer>
	Definition: Must be 2. Needed for of_thermal as cooling device
			identifier. Please refer to
			<devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt> for more
			details.
Example:
	qcom,ddr-cdev {
		compatible = "qcom,ddr-cooling-device";
		qcom,ddr-freq = <200000>,
				<451000>,
				<547000>,
				<681000>,
				<768000>,
				<1017000>,
				<1555000>,
				<1708000>,
				<2092000>,
				<2736000>,
				<3196000>;
		#cooling-cells = <2>;
        };
