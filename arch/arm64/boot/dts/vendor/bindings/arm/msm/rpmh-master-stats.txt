* RPMH Master Stats

Differet Subsystems maintains master data in SMEM.
It tells about the individual masters information at any given
time like "system sleep counts", "system sleep last entered at"
and "system sleep accumulated duration" etc. These stats can be
displayed using the sysfs interface.
To achieve this, device tree node has been added.

Additionally, RPMH master stats also maintains application processor's
master stats. It uses profiling units to calculate power down and power
up stats.

Same driver can be used for RPM based targets where Different Subsystems master
stats data can be read from SMEM. Such targets do not have profiling unit
register.

The required properties for rpmh-master-stats are:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Should be "qcom,rpmh-master-stats-v1".

- reg:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Specifies physical address of start of profiling unit.

Example:

qcom,rpmh-master-stats {
	compatible = "qcom,rpmh-master-stats";
	reg = <0xb221200 0x60>;
};
