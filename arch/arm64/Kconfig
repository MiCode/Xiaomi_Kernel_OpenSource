	  If a Cortex-A53 uses an AMBA AXI4 ACE interface to other processors
	  and is unable to accept a certain write via this interface, it will

	  Under certain conditions this erratum can cause a clean line eviction

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to

	  part, a load at EL0 from a virtual address that matches the bottom 32
	  bits of the virtual address used by a recent load at (AArch64) EL1
	  might return incorrect data.

	  The workaround is to write the contextidr_el1 register on exception
	  return to a 32-bit task.

	bool "Enable seccomp to safely compute untrusted bytecode"
	---help---
	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications
	  that may need to compute untrusted bytecode during their
	  execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
	  the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
	  their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
	  enabled via prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP), it cannot be disabled
	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
	  defined by each seccomp mode.

	  Speculation attacks against some high-performance processors can

	  If unsure, say Y.

config HARDEN_BRANCH_PREDICTOR
	bool "Harden the branch predictor against aliasing attacks" if EXPERT
	default y
	help
	  Speculation attacks against some high-performance processors rely on
	  being able to manipulate the branch predictor for a victim context by
	  executing aliasing branches in the attacker context.  Such attacks
	  can be partially mitigated against by clearing internal branch
	  predictor state and limiting the prediction logic in some situations.

	  This config option will take CPU-specific actions to harden the

	  firmware.

config SWP_EMULATION
	bool "Emulate SWP/SWPB instructions"
	help
	  ARMv8 obsoletes the use of A32 SWP/SWPB instructions such that
	  they are always undefined. Say Y here to enable software
	  emulation of these instructions for userspace using LDXR/STXR.

	  In some older versions of glibc [<=2.8] SWP is used during futex
	  trylock() operations with the assumption that the code will not
	  be preempted. This invalid assumption may be more likely to fail
	  with SWP emulation enabled, leading to deadlock of the user
	  application.

	  NOTE: when accessing uncached shared regions, LDXR/STXR rely
	  on an external transaction monitoring block called a global
	  monitor to maintain update atomicity. If your system does not
	  implement a global monitor, this option can cause programs that
	  perform SWP operations to uncached memory to deadlock.

	help
	  The CP15 barrier instructions - CP15ISB, CP15DSB, and

	  strongly recommended to use the ISB, DSB, and DMB
	  instructions instead.

	  Say Y here to enable software emulation of these
	  instructions for AArch32 userspace code. When this option is
	  enabled, CP15 barrier usage is traced which can help
	  identify software that needs updating.

	  Say Y here to enable software emulation of the instruction
	  for AArch32 userspace code.

	  Note: All the cpus on the system must have mixed endian support at EL0
	  for this feature to be enabled. If a new CPU - which doesn't support mixed
	  endian - is hotplugged in after this feature has been enabled, there could
	  be unexpected results in the applications.

	 Choosing this option will cause any unprotected (not using

	  User Access Override (UAO; part of the ARMv8.2 Extensions)

	  be overriden to be privileged.

	  This option changes get_user() and friends to use the 'unprivileged'
	  variant of the load/store instructions. This ensures that user-space
	  really did have access to the supplied memory. When addr_limit is
	  set to kernel memory the UAO bit will be set, allowing privileged
	  access to kernel memory.

	  Choosing this option will cause copy_to_user() et al to use user-space
	  memory permissions.

	  The feature is detected at runtime, the kernel will use the
	  regular load/store instructions if the cpu does not implement the
