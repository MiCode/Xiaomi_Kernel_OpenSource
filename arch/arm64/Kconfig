	  part, a load at EL0 from a virtual address that matches the bottom 32

	bool "Use bootloader kernel arguments if available"
	help
	  Uses the command-line options passed by the boot loader. If
	  the boot loader doesn't provide any, the default kernel command
	  string provided in CMDLINE will be used.

config CMDLINE_EXTEND
	bool "Extend bootloader kernel arguments"
	help
	  The command-line arguments provided by the boot loader will be
	  appended to the default kernel command string.

config CMDLINE_FORCE
	bool "Always use the default kernel command string"
	help
	  Always use the default kernel command string, even if the boot
	  loader passes other arguments to the kernel.
	  This is useful if you cannot or don't want to change the
	  command-line options your boot loader passes to the kernel.

	  This option provides support for runtime services provided
