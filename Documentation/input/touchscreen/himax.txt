Himax touch controller

The Himax touch controller is connected to host processor
via i2c. The controller generates interrupts when the
user touches the panel. The host controller is expected
to read the touch coordinates over i2c and pass the coordinates
to the rest of the system.

Required properties:

 - compatible           : Should be "himax,hxcommon"
 - reg                  : i2c slave address of the device.
 - interrupt-parent     : parent of interrupt.
 - himax,irq-gpio       : irq gpio.
 - himax,reset-gpio     : reset gpio.
 - vdd-supply           : Power supply needed to power up the device.
 - avdd-supply          : Power source required to power up i2c bus.
 - himax,panel-coords   : panel coordinates for the chip in pixels.
                                  It is a four tuple consisting of min x,
                                  min y, max x and max y values.
 - himax,display-coords : display coordinates in pixels. It is a four
                                  tuple consisting of min x, min y, max x and
                                  max y values

Optional properties:
 - himax,3v3-gpio       : gpio acting as 3.3 v supply.
 - himax,report_type    : Multi-touch protocol type. Default 0.
                                  0 for protocol A, 1 for protocol B.
