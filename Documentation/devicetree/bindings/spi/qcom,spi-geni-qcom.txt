GENI based Qualcomm Universal Peripheral (QUP) Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

The QUP v3 core is a GENI based AHB slave that provides a common data path
(an output FIFO and an input FIFO) for serial peripheral interface (SPI)
mini-core.

SPI in master mode supports up to 50MHz, up to four chip selects, programmable
data path from 4 bits to 32 bits and numerous protocol variants.

Required properties:
- compatible:	  Should contain "qcom,spi-geni"
- reg:		  Should contain base register location and length
- interrupts:	  Interrupt number used by this controller
- clocks:	  Should contain the core clock and the AHB clock.
- clock-names:	  Should be "core" for the core clock and "iface" for the
		  AHB clock.
- pinctrl-names:  Property should contain "default" and "sleep" for the
		  pin configurations during the usecase and during idle.
- pinctrl-x:	  phandle to the default/sleep pin configurations.
- #address-cells: Number of cells required to define a chip select
		  address on the SPI bus. Should be set to 1.
- #size-cells:	  Should be zero.
- spi-max-frequency: Specifies maximum SPI clock frequency,
		     Units - Hz. Definition as per
		     Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
- qcom,wrapper-core: Wrapper QUPv3 core containing this SPI controller.

Optional properties:
- qcom,rt:	Specifies if the framework worker thread for this
		controller device should have "real-time" priority.
- qcom,disable-autosuspend: Specifies to disable runtime PM auto suspend.

SPI slave nodes must be children of the SPI master node and can contain
the following properties.

Required properties:
- compatible:     Should contain:
                  "qcom,spi-msm-codec-slave" for external codec control

- reg:            Chip select address of device.

- spi-max-frequency: Maximum SPI clocking speed of device in Hz.

Optional properties:
- spi-cpha:       Empty property indicating device requires
                  shifted clock phase (CPHA) mode.

- qcom,slv-ctrl : Set this flag to configure QUPV3 as SPI slave controller.

- qcom,disable-dma : Set this flag to ensure only fifo mode is used for
			transfers. FIFO mode does not work when FW of SE
			is configured in GSI mode.

Other optional properties described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

Example:

	qupv3_spi10: spi@a84000 {
		compatible = "qcom,spi-geni";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0xa84000 0x4000>;
		reg-names = "se_phys";
		clock-names = "se-clk", "m-ahb", "s-ahb";
		clocks = <&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP0_S0_CLK>,
			<&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP_0_M_AHB_CLK>,
			<&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP_0_S_AHB_CLK>;
		pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
		pinctrl-0 = <&qup_1_spi_2_active>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&qup_1_spi_2_sleep>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 354 0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <19200000>;
		qcom,wrapper-core = <&qupv3_0>;

		dev@0 {
			compatible = "dummy,slave";
			reg = <0>;
			spi-max-frequency = <9600000>;
		};
	};
