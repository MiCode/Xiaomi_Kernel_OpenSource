* Qualcomm ConNectivity SubSystem Platform Driver

This platform driver adds support for the CNSS subsystem used for PCIe
based Wi-Fi devices. It also adds support to integrate PCIe WLAN module
to subsystem restart framework. Apart from that, it also manages the
3.3V voltage regulator, WLAN Enable GPIO signal and PCIe link dynamically
with support for suspend and resume by retaining the PCI config space
states when PCIe link is shutdown. The main purpose of this device tree
entry below is to invoke the CNSS platform driver and provide handle to
the WLAN enable GPIO, 3.3V fixed voltage regulator resources. It also
provides the reserved RAM dump memory location and size.

Required properties:
  - compatible: "qcom,cnss"
  - wlan-en-gpio: WLAN_EN GPIO signal specified by QCA6174 specifications
  - vdd-wlan-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
  - pinctrl-names: Names corresponding to the numbered pinctrl states
  - pinctrl-<n>: Pinctrl states as described in
                 bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
  - qcom,wlan-rc-num: PCIe root complex number which WLAN chip is attached to

Optional properties:
  - qcom,notify-modem-status: Boolean property to decide whether modem
    notification should be enabled or not in this platform
  - wlan-soc-swreg-supply: phandle to the external 1.15V regulator for QCA6174
  - qcom,wlan-uart-access: Boolean property to decide whether QCA6174
    has exclusive access to UART.
  - vdd-wlan-io-supply: phandle to the 1.8V IO regulator for QCA6174
  - vdd-wlan-xtal-supply: phandle to the 1.8V XTAL regulator for QCA6174
  - vdd-wlan-core-supply: phandle to the 1.3V CORE regulator for QCA6174
  - vdd-wlan-sp2t-supply: phandle to the 2.7V SP2T regulator for QCA6174
  - qcom,wlan-smmu-iova-address: I/O virtual address range as <start length>
    format to be used for allocations associated between WLAN/PCIe and SMMU
  - qcom,wlan-ramdump-dynamic: To enable CNSS RAMDUMP collection
    by providing the size of CNSS DUMP
  - reg: Memory regions defined as starting address and size
  - reg-names: Names of the memory regions defined in reg entry
  - wlan-bootstrap-gpio: WLAN_BOOTSTRAP GPIO signal specified by QCA6174
                         which should be drived depending on platforms

Example:

    qcom,cnss@0d400000 {
        compatible = "qcom,cnss";
        reg = <0x0d400000 0x200000>;
        reg-names = "ramdump";
        qcom,wlan-ramdump-dynamic = <0x200000>;
        wlan-en-gpio = <&msmgpio 82 0>;
        vdd-wlan-supply = <&wlan_vreg>;
        qcom,notify-modem-status;
        wlan-soc-swreg-supply = <&pma8084_l27>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        pinctrl-0 = <&cnss_default>;
        qcom,wlan-rc-num = <0>;
        qcom,wlan-smmu-iova-address = <0 0x10000000>;
    };
