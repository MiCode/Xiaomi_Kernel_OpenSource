Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SDXLEMUR CPU clock driver
-----------------------------------------------------

It is the clock controller driver which provides higher frequency
clocks and allows CPU frequency scaling on qcs405 based platforms.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Shall contain following:
		"qcom,sdxlemur-apsscc"
		"qcom,sdxnightjar-apsscc"
- clocks:	Phandle to the clock device.
- clock-names:	Names of the used clocks. Shall contain following:
		"xo_ao", "gpll0_ao"
- reg:	Shall contain base register offset and size.
- reg-names:	Names of the bases for the above registers. Shall contain following:
		"apcs_cmd", "apcs_pll"
- vdd-pll-supply:	The regulator(active only) powering the Analog logic of APSS PLL.
- cpu-vdd-supply:	The regulator(active only) powering the APSS RCG.
- qcom,speedX-bin-vZ:	A table of CPU frequency (Hz) to regulator voltage (uV) mapping.
			Format: <freq uV>
			This represents the max frequency possible for each possible
			power configuration for a CPU that's binned as speed bin X,
			speed bin revision Z. Version can be between [0-3].
- #clock-cells:	Shall contain 1.

Optional properties:
- reg-names:	"efuse"

Example:
	clock_cpu: qcom,clock-cpu@17808100 {
		compatible = "qcom,sdxlemur-apsscc";
		clocks = <&rpmhcc RPMH_CXO_CLK>>;
			  <&gcc GPLL0_AO_OUT_MAIN>;;
		clock-names = "xo_ao", "gpll0_ao" ;
		reg = <0x17810008 0x8>, <0x17808100 0x44>;
		reg-names = "apcs_cmd" , "apcs_pll";
		vdd-pll-supply = <&VDD_CX_LEVEL_AO>;
		cpu-vdd-supply = <&VDD_CX_LEVEL_AO>;
		qcom,speed0-bin-v0 =
			<          0 RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_OFF>,
			<  345600000 RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_LOW_SVS>,
			<  576000000 RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_SVS>,
			< 1094400000 RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_NOM>,
			< 1555200000 RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_TURBO>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};
