  The VM Identification is a virtual node that conveys to the VM information
  about itself in the context of the hypervisor-based system and may be
  present as a child of the /hypervisor node

          Must contain the VM-ID compatible string, which is provisionally
          specified as "qcom,haven-vm-id". This should be preceded by
          a string that specifies the VM ID API version, which is currently
          1.0, thus "qcom,haven-vm-id-1.0".

      qcom,owner-vmid:

        description: Contains the hypervisor VMID of the VM’s owner. The owner
                     is the VM that allocated and created the VM. VMs directly
                     managed by the resource manager, such as the HLOS do not
                     have an owner.

      qcom,image-name:
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string
        description: contains the VM image name string.

      qcom,swid:
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
        description: must contain the Qualcomm PIL software ID value.
