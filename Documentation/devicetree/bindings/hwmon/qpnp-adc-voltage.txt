Qualcomm's QPNP PMIC Voltage ADC Arbiter

QPNP PMIC Voltage ADC (VADC) provides interface to clients to read
Voltage. A 15 bit ADC is used for Voltage measurements. There are multiple
peripherals to the VADC and the scope of the driver is to provide interface
for the USR peripheral of the VADC.

VADC node

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "qcom,qpnp-vadc" for Voltage ADC driver.
- reg : offset and length of the PMIC Aribter register map.
- address-cells : Must be one.
- size-cells : Must be zero.
- interrupts : The USR bank peripheral VADC interrupt.
- interrupt-names : Should contain "eoc-int-en-set".
- qcom,adc-bit-resolution : Bit resolution of the ADC.
- qcom,adc-vdd-reference : Voltage reference used by the ADC.

Channel nodes
NOTE: Atleast one Channel node is required.

Optional properties:
- qcom,vadc-poll-eoc: Use polling instead of interrupts for End of Conversion completion.
- qcom,pmic-revid : Phandle pointing to the revision peripheral node. Use it to query the
		    PMIC type and revision for applying the appropriate temperature
		    compensation parameters.

Client required property:
- qcom,<consumer name>-vadc : The phandle to the corresponding vadc device.
			The consumer name passed to the driver when calling
			qpnp_get_vadc() is used to associate the client
			with the corresponding device.

Required properties:
- label : Channel name used for sysfs entry.
- reg : AMUX channel number.
- qcom,decimation : Sampling rate to use for the individual channel measurement.
		    Select from following unsigned int.
		    0 : 512
		    1 : 1K
		    2 : 2K
		    3 : 4K
- qcom,pre-div-channel-scaling : Pre-div used for the channel before the signal
				 is being measured. Some of the AMUX channels
				 support dividing the signal from a predetermined
				 ratio. The configuration for this node is to know
				 the pre-determined ratio and use it for post scaling.
				 Select from the following unsinged int.
				 0 : {1, 1}
				 1 : {1, 3}
				 2 : {1, 4}
				 3 : {1, 6}
				 4 : {1, 20}
- qcom,calibration-type : Reference voltage to use for channel calibration.
			  Channel calibration is dependendent on the channel.
			  Certain channels like XO_THERM, BATT_THERM use ratiometric
			  calibration. Most other channels fall under absolute calibration.
			  Select from the following strings.
			  "absolute" : Uses the 625mv and 1.25V reference channels.
			  "ratiometric" : Uses the reference Voltage/GND for calibration.
- qcom,scale-function : Scaling function used to convert raw ADC code to units specific to
			a given channel.
			Select from the following unsigned int.
			0 : Default scaling to convert raw adc code to voltage.
			1 : Conversion to temperature based on btm parameters.
			2 : Returns result in degC for 100k pull-up.
			3 : Returns current across 0.1 ohm resistor.
			4 : Returns XO thermistor voltage in degree's Centigrade.
			5 : Returns result in degC for 150k pull-up.
			9 : Conversion to temperature based on -15~55 allowable
			    battery charging tempeature setting for btm parameters.
- qcom,hw-settle-time : Settling period for the channel before ADC read.
			Select from the following unsigned int.
			0 : 0us
			1 : 100us
			2 : 200us
			3 : 300us
			4 : 400us
			5 : 500us
			6 : 600us
			7 : 700us
			8 : 800us
			9 : 900us
			0xa : 1ms
			0xb : 2ms
			0xc : 4ms
			0xd : 6ms
			0xe : 8ms
			0xf : 10ms
- qcom,fast-avg-setup : Average number of samples to be used for measurement. Fast averaging
			provides the option to obtain a single measurement from the ADC that
			is an average of multiple samples. The value selected is 2^(value)
			Select from the following unsigned int.
			0 : 1
			1 : 2
			2 : 4
			3 : 8
			4 : 16
			5 : 32
			6 : 64
			7 : 128
			8 : 256

client_node {
	qcom,client-vadc = <&pm8941_vadc>;
};

/* Clients have an option of measuring an analog signal through an MPP.
   MPP block is not part of the VADC block but is an individual PMIC
   block that has an option to support clients to configure an MPP as
   an analog input which can be routed through one of the VADC pre-mux
   inputs. Here is an example of how to configure an MPP as an analog
