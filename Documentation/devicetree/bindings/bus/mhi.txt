MHI Host Interface

MHI used by the host to control and communicate with modem over
high speed peripheral bus.

==============
Node Structure
==============

Main node properties:

- mhi,max-channels
  Usage: required
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: Maximum number of channels supported by this controller

- mhi,chan-cfg
  Usage: required
  Value type: Array of <u32>
  Definition: Array of tuples describe channel configuration.
	1st element: Physical channel number
	2nd element: Transfer ring length in elements
	3rd element: Event ring associated with this channel
	4th element: Channel direction as defined by enum dma_data_direction
		0 = Bidirectional data transfer
		1 = UL data transfer
		2 = DL data transfer
		3 = No direction, not a regular data transfer channel
	5th element: Channel doorbell mode configuration as defined by
	enum MHI_BRSTMODE
		2 = burst mode disabled
		3 = burst mode enabled
	6th element: mhi doorbell configuration, valid only when burst mode
	enabled.
		0 = Use default (device specific) polling configuration
		For UL channels, value specifies the timer to poll MHI context
		in milliseconds.
		For DL channels, the threshold to poll the MHI context
		in multiple of eight ring element.
	7th element: Channel execution enviornment as defined by enum MHI_EE
		1 = Bootloader stage
		2 = AMSS mode
	8th element: data transfer type accepted as defined by enum
	MHI_XFER_TYPE
		0 = accept cpu address for buffer
		1 = accept skb
		2 = accept scatterlist
		3 = offload channel, does not accept any transfer type
	9th element: Bitwise configuration settings for the channel
		Bit mask:
		BIT(0) : LPM notify, this channel master requre lpm enter/exit
		notifications.
		BIT(1) : Offload channel, MHI host only involved in setting up
		the data pipe. Not involved in active data transfer.
		BIT(2) : Must switch to doorbell mode whenever MHI M0 state
		transition happens.
		BIT(3) : MHI bus driver pre-allocate buffer for this channel.
		If set, clients not allowed to queue buffers. Valid only for DL
		direction.

- mhi,chan-names
  Usage: required
  Value type: Array of <string>
  Definition: Channel names configured in mhi,chan-cfg.

- mhi,ev-cfg
  Usage: required
  Value type: Array of <u32>
  Definition: Array of tuples describe event configuration.
	1st element: Event ring length in elements
	2nd element: Interrupt moderation time in ms
	3rd element: MSI associated with this event ring
	4th element: Dedicated channel number, if it's a dedicated event ring
	5th element: Event ring priority, set to 1 for now
	6th element: Event doorbell mode configuration as defined by
	enum MHI_BRSTMODE
		2 = burst mode disabled
		3 = burst mode enabled
	7th element: Bitwise configuration settings for the channel
		Bit mask:
		BIT(0) : Event ring associated with hardware channels
		BIT(1) : Client manages the event ring (use by napi_poll)
		BIT(2) : Event ring associated with offload channel
		BIT(3) : Event ring dedicated to control events only

- mhi,timeout
  Usage: optional
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: Maximum timeout in ms wait for state and cmd completion

- mhi,fw-name
  Usage: optional
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: Firmware image name to upload

- mhi,edl-name
  Usage: optional
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: Firmware image name for emergency download

- mhi,fbc-download
  Usage: optional
  Value type: <bool>
  Definition: If set true, image specified by fw-name is for full image

- mhi,sbl-size
  Usage: optional
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: Size of SBL image in bytes

- mhi,seg-len
  Usage: optional
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: Size of each segment to allocate for BHIe vector table

Children node properties:

MHI drivers that require DT can add driver specific information as a child node.

- mhi,chan
  Usage: Required
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: Channel name

========
Example:
========
mhi_controller {
	mhi,max-channels = <105>;
	mhi,chan-cfg = <0 64 2 1 2 1 2 0 0>, <1 64 2 2 2 1 2 0 0>,
		       <2 64 1 1 2 1 1 0 0>, <3 64 1 2 2 1 1 0 0>;
	mhi,chan-names = "LOOPBACK", "LOOPBACK",
			 "SAHARA", "SAHARA";
	mhi,ev-cfg = <64 1 1 0 1 2 8>
		     <64 1 2 0 1 2 0>;
	mhi,fw-name = "sbl1.mbn";
	mhi,timeout = <500>;

	children_node {
		mhi,chan = "LOOPBACK"
		<driver specific properties>
	};
};
