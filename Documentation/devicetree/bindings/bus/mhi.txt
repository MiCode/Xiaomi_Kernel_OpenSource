Node Structure
==============

Main node properties:

- mhi,max-channels
  Usage: required
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: Maximum number of channels supported by this controller

- mhi,timeout
  Usage: optional
  Value type: <u32>

  Usage: optional
  Value type: <bool>
  Definition: Set true, if PCIe controller does not have full access to host
	DDR, and we're using a dedicated memory pool like cma, or
	carveout pool. Pool must support atomic allocation.

- mhi,buffer-len
  Usage: optional
  Value type: <bool>
  Definition: MHI automatically pre-allocate buffers for some channel.
	Set the length of buffer size to allocate. If not default

  Definition: MHI host driver to automatically start channels once mhi device
	driver probe is complete. This should be only set true if initial
	handshake iniaitead by external modem.

- mhi,wake-capable
  Usage: optional
  Value type: <bool>
  Definition: Time sensitive data channel, host should process all pending data
	before system suspend.

- mhi,chan-type
  Usage: optional
  Value type: <u32>
