* Universal Flash Storage (UFS) Host Controller

UFSHC nodes are defined to describe on-chip UFS host controllers.
Each UFS controller instance should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible list, contains "jedec,ufs-1.1", "qcom,ufshc"
- interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for UFS host controller IRQ>
- reg               : <registers mapping>

Optional properties:
- ufs-phy               : phandle to UFS PHY node
- vcc-supply            : phandle to VCC supply regulator node
- vccq-supply           : phandle to VCCQ supply regulator node
- vccq2-supply          : phandle to VCCQ2 supply regulator node
- vcc-supply-1p8        : For embedded UFS devices, valid VCC range is 1.7-1.95V
                          or 2.7-3.6V. This boolean property when set, specifies
			  to use low voltage range of 1.7-1.95V. Note for external
			  UFS cards this property is invalid and valid VCC range is
			  always 2.7-3.6V.
- vcc-max-microamp      : specifies max. load that can be drawn from vcc supply
- vccq-max-microamp     : specifies max. load that can be drawn from vccq supply
- vccq2-max-microamp    : specifies max. load that can be drawn from vccq2 supply

- clocks                : List of phandle and clock specifier pairs
- clock-names           : List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
                          order as the clocks property.
- max-clock-frequency-hz : List of maximum operating frequency stored in the same
                           order as the clocks property. If this property is not
			   defined or a value in the array is "0" then it is assumed
			   that the frequency is set by the parent clock or a
			   fixed rate clock source.

Note: If above properties are not defined it can be assumed that the supply
regulators or clocks are always on.

Example:
	ufshc@0xfc598000 {
		compatible = "jedec,ufs-1.1";
		reg = <0xfc598000 0x800>;
		interrupts = <0 28 0>;

		ufs-phy = <&ufsphy>;
		vcc-supply = <&xxx_reg1>;
		vcc-supply-1p8;
		vccq-supply = <&xxx_reg2>;
		vccq2-supply = <&xxx_reg3>;
		vcc-max-microamp = 500000;
		vccq-max-microamp = 200000;
		vccq2-max-microamp = 200000;

		clocks = <&core 0>, <&ref 0>, <&iface 0>;
		clock-names = "core_clk", "ref_clk", "iface_clk";
		max-clock-frequency-hz = <100000000 19200000 0>;
	};

For UFS host controller in MSM platform following clocks are required -
    Controller clock source -
        "core_clk_src", max-clock-frequency-hz = 200MHz

    Controller System clock branch:
        "core_clk" - Controller core clock

    AHB/AXI interface clocks:
        "iface_clk" - AHB interface clock
        "bus_clk" - AXI bus master clock

    PHY to controller symbol synchronization clocks:
        "rx_lane0_sync_clk" - RX Lane 0
        "rx_lane1_sync_clk" - RX Lane 1
        "tx_lane0_sync_clk" - TX Lane 0
        "tx_lane1_sync_clk" - TX Lane 1

    Optional reference clock input to UFS device
        "ref_clk", max-clock-frequency-hz = 19.2MHz
