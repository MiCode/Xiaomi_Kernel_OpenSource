SPS (Smart Peripheral Switch) may be used as a DMA engine to move data
in either the Peripheral-to-Peripheral (a.k.a. BAM-to-BAM) mode or the
Peripheral-to-Memory (a.k.a. BAM-System) mode. SPS includes BAM (Bus
Access Module) hardware block, BAM DMA peripheral, and pipe memory.

Required property:
  - compatible: should be "qcom,msm_sps" or "qcom,msm_sps_4k"

Optional properties:
  - reg: offset and size for the memory mapping, including maps for
    BAM DMA BAM, BAM DMA peripheral, pipe memory and reserved memory.
  - reg-names: indicates various resources passed to driver (via reg
    property) by name. "reg-names" examples are "bam_mem", "core_mem"
    , "pipe_mem" and "res_mem".
  - interrupts: IRQ line
  - qcom,device-type: specify the device configuration of BAM DMA and
    pipe memory. Can be one of
        1 - With BAM DMA and without pipe memory
        2 - With BAM DMA and with pipe memory
        3 - Without BAM DMA and without pipe memory
  - qcom,pipe-attr-ee: BAM pipes are attributed to a specific EE, with
    which we can know the pipes belong to apps side and can have the
    error interrupts at the pipe level.
  - clocks: This property shall provide a list of entries each of which
    contains a phandle to clock controller device and a macro that is
    the clock's name in hardware.These should be "clock_rpm" as clock
    controller phandle and "clk_pnoc_sps_clk" as macro for "dfab_clk"
    and "clock_gcc" as clock controller phandle and "clk_gcc_bam_dma_ahb_clk"
    as macro for "dma_bam_pclk".
  - clock-names: This property shall contain the clock input names used
    by driver in same order as the clocks property.These should be "dfab_clk"
    and "dma_bam_pclk".

Example:

	qcom,sps@f9980000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm_sps";
		reg = <0xf9984000 0x15000>,
		      <0xf9999000 0xb000>,
		      <0xfe803000 0x4800>;
		interrupts = <0 94 0>;
		qcom,device-type = <2>;
		qcom,pipe-attr-ee;
		clocks = <&clock_rpm clk_pnoc_sps_clk>,
			 <&clock_gcc clk_gcc_bam_dma_ahb_clk>;
		clock-names = "dfab_clk", "dma_bam_pclk";
	};
