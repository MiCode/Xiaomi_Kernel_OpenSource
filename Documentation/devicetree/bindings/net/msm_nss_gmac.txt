* Qualcomm Technologies Inc. NSS GMAC Platform Driver.

This driver configures GMAC interfaces on the board, along with MII/MDIO interfaces and PHY devices.This forms the base interface for HLOS/Crypto Drivers.
This driver has 2 sections listed below, one common to all the GMACs and other specific to each GMAC interface.

1. Driver access details common to all GMACs

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,nss-gmac-common"
- reg-names: Indicates various resources passed to driver by name.
		"nss_reg_base", "qsgmii_reg_base", "clk_ctl_base".
		These correspond to different register bases of GMAC.
- reg: physical address and length of the register set for the device.

Example:
nss-gmac-common@fc800000 {
	compatible = "qcom,nss-gmac-common";
	reg-names = "nss_reg_base" , "qsgmii_reg_base", "clk_ctl_base";
	reg = <0xfc800000 0x0000ffff>,
	    <0xfc900000 0x0000ffff>,
	    <0xfc400000 0x00004000>;
};

Required properties:
- device_type: = "network";
- compatible: = should be "qcom,nss-gmac";
- reg:  physical address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: GMAC interrupts to this processor.
- phy-mode:  Specifies PHY type being used (eg., "sgmii", "rgmii", "gmii" etc).
- qcom,id: Unique Identifier for the GMAC block.This field is unique identifier for the core,
	                which is also used as an index for global nss context.
- qcom,pcs-chanid: Specifies the channel ID used by PHY to communicate with MAC Chip.
- qcom,phy-mdio-addr: MDIO port number, used for communication with PHY chips
- qcom,poll-required: Enables disables auto-negotiation , thus polling the PHY chip to
			determine the configuration attributes of relavant chips.
- qcom,rgmii-delay: Enables delay during RGMI clock configuration
- qcom,forced-speed: The speed setting forced onto the GMAC, rather then probed.
- qcom,forced-duplex: The Duplex setting forced onto the GMAC,rather then probed.
- local-mac-address: Dummy MAC Address to be used at the time of GMAC initialization

Optional properties:

gmac0: ethernet@e7000000 {
	device_type = "network";
	compatible = "qcom,nss-gmac";
	reg = <0xe7000000 0x200000>;
	interrupts = <0 242 0>;
	phy-mode = "sgmii";
	qcom,id = <0>;
	qcom,pcs-chanid = <1>;
	qcom,phy-mdio-addr = <0>;
	qcom,poll-required = <1>;
	qcom,rgmii-delay = <0>;
	qcom,forced-speed = <0>;
	qcom,forced-duplex = <10>;
	local-mac-address = [000000000000];
	mdiobus = <&mdio0>;
};
