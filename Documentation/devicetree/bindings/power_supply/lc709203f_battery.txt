lc709203f battery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required properties :
 - compatible : Should contain "onsemi,lc709203f".
 - onsemi,initial-rsoc : INITIAL_RSOC register value to be written

Optional properties:
 - onsemi,tz-name : Thermal zone name.
 - onsemi,thermistor-beta : THERMISTOR_B register value to be written
 - onsemi,appli-adjustment: adjustment appli of parameter.
 - onsemi,thermistor-adjustment: adjustment thermistor pack.
 - onsemi,kernel-threshold-soc: Minimum SoC for kernel read from device.
	Bootloader jumps to kernel when SoC is more than this value.
	Driver make this SoC as 0% before reporting it to teh framework.
 - onsemi,kernel-maximum-soc: Maximum SoC for kernel read from device.
	Kernel read maximum SoC from device for given battery. Kernel
	translate the SoC to 100% before reporting to framework if it
	reads equal/more than this value.

Note: The device has capabilty to read battery temp through thermistor.
This also calulate SoC based on temperature of battery. If thermistor
is not connected to this device on a given platform then the temp can be
written on the the device register to consider the battery temperature
on SoC calculation.

If battery thermistor is connected to the device's Tsense pin then following
properties are required:
	onsemi,thermistor-beta

if battery thermistor isnot connected to device and temperature is read from
other source then following properties are required:
	onsemi,tz-name

Example:

	lc709203f@0b {
		compatible = "onsemi,lc709203f";
		onsemi,tz-name = "battery-temp";
		onsemi,thermistor-beta = 0x0d34;
		onsemi,initial-rsoc = 0xAA55;
		onsemi,kernel-threshold-soc = <5>;
		onsemi,kernel-maximum-soc = <99>;
	};
