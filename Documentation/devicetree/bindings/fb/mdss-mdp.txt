			 "qcom,memblock-reserve" is not defined when continuous
			 splash screen feature is enabled.
- linux,contiguous-region: Phandle to the continuous memory region reserved for
			 frame-buffer or continuous splash screen. Size of this
			 region is dependent on the display panel resolution and
			 buffering scheme for frame-buffer node. Currently driver
			 uses double buffering.

			 Number of frame-buffers reserved = 2.
			 Size = 1920*1080*4*2 = ROUND_1MB(15.8MB) = 16MB.

			frame buffer virtual device.
- qcom,mdss-fb-splash-logo-enabled:    The boolean entry enables the framebuffer
					driver to display the splash logo image.
					It is independent of continuous splash
					screen feature and has no relation with
					qcom,cont-splash-enabled entry present in
					panel configuration.

					for mdss power collapse in idle
					screen use cases with smart panels.

				LED for notifying that the device is in boot
				process.

		       from base module.
		       -- qcom,mdss-mdss-sspp-igc-lut-off: This 32 bit value provides the
		              offset to the IGC lut rams from mdp_phys base.
		       -- qcom,mdss-sspp-vig-pcc-off: This 32 bit value provides the offset
		              to PCC block from the VIG pipe base address.
		       -- qcom,mdss-sspp-rgb-pcc-off: This 32 bit value provides the offset
		              to PCC block from the RGB pipe base address.
		       -- qcom,mdss-sspp-dma-pcc-off: This 32 bit value provides the offset
		              to PCC block from the DMA pipe base address.
		       -- qcom,mdss-dspp-pcc-off: This 32 bit value provides the offset
		              to PCC block from the DSPP pipe base address.
		       -- qcom,mdss-lm-pgc-off: This 32 bit value provides the offset
		               to PGC block from the layer mixer base address.
		       -- qcom,mdss-dspp-gamut-off: This 32 bit value provides the offset
		               to gamut block from DSPP base address.
		       -- qcom,mdss-dspp-pgc-off: This 32 bit value provides the offset to
		               PGC block from the DSPP base address.

- qcom,mdss-scaler-offsets: A node that lists the offsets of scaler blocks
		            from base module.
		            -- qcom,mdss-vig-scaler-off: This 32 bit value provides the
		                   offset to vig scaler from vig pipe base.
		            -- qcom,mdss-vig-scaler-lut-off: This 32 bit value provides the
		                   offset to vig scaler lut from vig pipe base.
		            -- qcom,mdss-has-dest-scaler: Boolean property to indicate the
		                   presence of destination scaler block.
		            -- qcom,mdss-dest-block-off: This 32 bit value provides the
		                   offset from mdp base to destination scaler block.
		            -- qcom,mdss-dest-scaler-off: Array containing offsets of
		                   destination scalar modules from the scaler block.
		            -- qcom,mdss-dest-scaler-lut-off: Array containing offsets of destination
		                   scaler lut tables from scalar block.

				  indpendent rotator. Indpendent rotator has
				  separate DMA pipe working in block mode only.

- smmu_mdp_***:	Child nodes representing the mdss smmu virtual devices.
		Mandatory smmu v2 and not required for smmu v1.

Subnode properties:
- compatible :		Compatible name used in smmu v2.
			smmu_v2 names should be:

						unsecure mdp domain.
			"qcom,smmu_rot_unsec"	- smmu context bank device for
						unsecure rotation domain.
			"qcom,smmu_mdp_sec" 	- smmu context bank device for
						secure mdp domain.
			"qcom,smmu_rot_sec"	- smmu context bank device for
						secure rotation domain.
