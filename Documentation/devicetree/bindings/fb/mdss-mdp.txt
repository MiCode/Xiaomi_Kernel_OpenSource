				property: qcom,mdss-mixer-intf-off. Assumes
				that AD blocks are aligned with the mixer
				offsets as well (i.e. the first mixer offset
				corresponds to the same pathway as the first
				AD offset).

			writeback wfd block in MDSS as opposed to writeback
			block that is shared between rotator and wfd.

				that can be supported without underflow.
				This is a low bandwidth threshold which should
				be applied in most scenarios to be safe from
				underflows when unable to satisfy bandwith
				requirements.
- qcom,max-bandwidth-high-kbps:	This value indicates the max bandwidth in KB
				that can be supported without underflow.
				This is a high bandwidth threshold which can be
				applied in scenarios where panel interface can
				be more tolerant to memory latency such as
				command mode panels.

				writes that can be allowed from rotator client. Default
				value is 16 which is the maximum. This value can be
				used to reduce the pending writes limit dynamically
				and can be tuned to match performance requirements
				depending upon system state.

Fudge Factors:			Fudge factors are used to boost demand for
				resources like bus bandswidth, clk rate etc. to
				overcome system inefficiencies and avoid any
				glitches. These fudge factors are expressed in
				terms of numerator and denominator. First value
				is numerator followed by denominator. They all
				are optional but highly recommended.
				Ex:
				x = value to be fudged
				a = numerator, default value is 1
				b = denominator, default value is 1
				FUDGE(x, a, b) = ((x * a) / b)

Child nodes representing the frame buffer virtual devices.

Subnode properties:
- compatible :		Must be "qcom,mdss-fb"
- cell-index :		Index representing frame buffer
- qcom,mdss-mixer-swap: A boolean property that indicates if the mixer muxes
			 need to be swapped based on the target panel.
			 By default the property is not defined.
- qcom,mdss-fb-split:	 Array of splitted framebuffer size. There should
			 be only two values in this property. The values
			 correspond to the left and right size respectively.
			 MDP muxes two mixer output together before sending to
			 the panel interface and these values are used to set
			 each mixer width, so the sum of these two values
			 should be equal to the panel x-resolution.

			 Note that if the sum of two values is not equal to
			 x-resolution or this subnode itself is not defined
			 in device tree there are two cases: 1)split is not
			 enabled if framebuffer size is less than max mixer
			 width; 2) the defaut even split is enabled if frambuffer
			 size is greater than max mixer width.
- qcom,memblock-reserve: Specifies the memory location and the size reserved
			 for the framebuffer used to display the splash screen.
			 This property is required whenever the continuous splash
			 screen feature is enabled for the corresponding
			 framebuffer device.
- qcom,mdss-fb-splash-logo-enabled:    The boolean entry enables the framebuffer
					driver to display the splash logo image.
					It is independent of continuous splash
					screen feature and has no relation with
					qcom,cont-splash-enabled entry present in
					panel configuration.
