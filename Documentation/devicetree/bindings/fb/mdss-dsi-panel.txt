					engine.
- qcom,split-mode:			String property indicating which split mode MDP should use. Valid
					entries are "pingpong-split" and "dualctl-split".
					This property is mutually exclusive with qcom,lm-split.
- qcom,mdss-dsc-version:		An 8 bit value indicates the DSC version supported by panel. Bits[0.3]
					provides information about minor version while Bits[4.7] provides
					major version information. It supports only DSC rev 1(Major).1(Minor)
					right now.
- qcom,mdss-dsc-scr-version:		Each DSC version can have multiple SCR. This 8 bit value indicates
					current SCR revision information supported by panel.
- qcom,mdss-dsc-encoders:		An integer value indicating how many DSC encoders should be used
					to drive data stream to DSI.
					Default value is 1 and max value is 2.
					2 encoder should be used only if qcom,mdss-lm-split or
					qcom,split-mode with pingpong-split is used.
- qcom,mdss-dsc-slice-height:		An integer value indicates the dsc slice height.
- qcom,mdss-dsc-slice-width:		An integer value indicates the dsc slice width.
					Multiple of slice width should be equal to panel-width.
					Maximum 2 slices per DSC encoder can be used so if 2 DSC encoders
					are used then minimum slice width is equal to panel-width/4.
- qcom,mdss-dsc-slice-per-pkt:		An integer value indicates the slice per dsi packet.
- qcom,mdss-dsc-bit-per-component: 	An integer value indicates the bits per component before compression.
- qcom,mdss-dsc-bit-per-pixel:		An integer value indicates the bits per pixel after compression.
- qcom,mdss-dsc-block-prediction-enable: A boolean value to enable/disable the block prediction at decoder.
- qcom,mdss-dsc-config-by-manufacture-cmd: A boolean to indicates panel use manufacture command to setup pps
					instead of standard dcs type 0x0A.
- qcom,dba-panel:	Indicates whether the current panel is used as a display bridge
					to a non-DSI interface.
- qcom,bridge-name:			A string to indicate the name of the bridge chip connected to DSI. qcom,bridge-name
					is required if qcom,dba-panel is defined for the panel.
- qcom,hdmi-mode:			Indicates where current panel is HDMI mode, otherwise, it will be DVI mode.
- qcom,adjust-timer-wakeup-ms:		An integer value to indicate the timer delay(in ms) to accommodate
					s/w delay while configuring the event timer wakeup logic.

- qcom,mdss-dsi-display-timings:	Parent node that lists the different resolutions that the panel supports.
					Each child represents timings settings for a specific resolution.
- qcom,mdss-dsi-post-init-delay:        Specifies required number of frames to wait so that panel can be functional
					to show proper display.

Additional properties added to the second level nodes that represent timings properties:
- qcom,mdss-dsi-timing-default:		Property that specifies the current child as the default
					timing configuration that will be used.
- qcom,mdss-dsi-timing-switch-command:	List of commands that need to be sent
					to panel when the resolution/timing switch happens dynamically.
					Refer to "qcom,mdss-dsi-on-command" section for adding commands.
- qcom,mdss-dsi-timing-switch-command-state:	String that specifies the ctrl state for sending resolution switch
					commands.
					"dsi_lp_mode" = DSI low power mode (default)
					"dsi_hs_mode" = DSI high speed mode

Note, if a given optional qcom,* binding is not present, then the driver will configure
the default values specified.

Note, all the "qcom,supply-*" properties have their definitions in mdss-dsi-txt.
