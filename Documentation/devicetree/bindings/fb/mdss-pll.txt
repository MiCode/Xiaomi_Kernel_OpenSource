Qualcomm MDSS pll for DSI/EDP/HDMI

mdss-pll is a pll controller device which supports pll devices that
are compatable with MIPI display serial interface specification,
HDMI and edp.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Compatible name used in the driver. Should be one of:
			"qcom,mdss_dsi_pll_8916", "qcom,mdss_dsi_pll_8939",
			"qcom,mdss_dsi_pll_8974", "qcom,mdss_dsi_pll_8994",
			"qcom,mdss_dsi_pll_8994", "qcom,mdss_dsi_pll_8909",
			"qcom,mdss_hdmi_pll", "qcom,mdss_hdmi_pll_8994",
			"qcom,mdss_dsi_pll_8992", "qcom,mdss_hdmi_pll_8992",
			"qcom,mdss_dsi_pll_8952", "qcom,mdss_dsi_pll_8976".
- cell-index:		Specifies the controller used
- reg:			offset and length of the register set for the device.
- reg-names :		names to refer to register sets related to this device
- gdsc-supply:		Phandle for gdsc regulator device node.
- vddio-supply:		Phandle for vddio regulator device node.
- clocks:		List of Phandles for clock device nodes
			needed by the device.
- clock-names:		List of clock names needed by the device.
- clock-rate:		List of clock rates in Hz.

Optional properties:
- label:	       	A string used to describe the driver used.
- vcca-supply:		Phandle for vcca regulator device node.

- qcom,mdss-en-pll-90-phase: 	Boolean property to indicate if the DSI PLL
				needs to be configured to have 90 phase difference
				between the BIT clock and BYTE clock frequencies.
- qcom,platform-supply-entries:	A node that lists the elements of the supply. There
				can be more than one instance of this binding,
				in which case the entry would be appended with
				the supply entry index.
				e.g. qcom,platform-supply-entry@0
				- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device.
				-- qcom,supply-name: name of the supply (vdd/vdda/vddio)
				-- qcom,supply-min-voltage: minimum voltage level (uV)
				-- qcom,supply-max-voltage: maximum voltage level (uV)
				-- qcom,supply-enable-load: load drawn (uA) from enabled supply
				-- qcom,supply-disable-load: load drawn (uA) from disabled supply
				-- qcom,supply-pre-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning on
				-- qcom,supply-post-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning on
				-- qcom,supply-pre-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning off
				-- qcom,supply-post-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning off

- linux,contiguous-region: Phandle to the continuous memory region reserved for
		   dynamic refresh rate data.
