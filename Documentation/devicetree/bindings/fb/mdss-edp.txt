QTI MDSS DP

MDSS DP is a display-port driver which supports panels that are compatible with
VESA DP and EDP display interface specification.

When configuring the optional properties for external backlight, one should also
configure the gpio that drives the pwm to it.

Required properties
- compatible :				Must be "qcom,mdss-edp".
- reg :						Offset and length of the register set for the
							device.
- reg-names :				Names to refer to register sets related to this
							device
- gdsc-supply :				Phandle for gdsc regulator device node.
- vdda-1p2-supply :			Phandle for 1.2V vdda regulator device node.
- vdda-0p9-supply :			Phandle for 0.9V vdda regulator device node.
- status :				A string that has to be set to "okay/ok" to enable
						the driver. By default this property will be set to
						"disable". Will be set to "ok/okay" status for
						specific platforms.
- qcom,mdss-fb-map:			pHandle that specifies the framebuffer to which the
					interface is mapped.
- clocks:				List of Phandles for clock device nodes
					needed by the device.
- clock-names:				List of clock names needed by the device.

Optional properties:
- qcom,<type>-supply-entries:		A node that lists the elements of the supply used by the
					a particular "type" of DSI modulee. The module "types"
					can be "core", "ctrl", and "phy". Within the same type,
					there can be more than one instance of this binding,
					in which case the entry would be appended with the
					supply entry index.
					e.g. qcom,ctrl-supply-entry@0
					-- qcom,supply-name: name of the supply (vdd/vdda/vddio)
					-- qcom,supply-min-voltage: minimum voltage level (uV)
					-- qcom,supply-max-voltage: maximum voltage level (uV)
					-- qcom,supply-enable-load: load drawn (uA) from enabled supply
					-- qcom,supply-disable-load: load drawn (uA) from disabled supply
					-- qcom,supply-pre-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning on
					-- qcom,supply-post-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning on
					-- qcom,supply-pre-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning off
					-- qcom,supply-post-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning off
