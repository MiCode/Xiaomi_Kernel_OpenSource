- reg: offset and length of the register regions(s) for the device.
- reg-names: a list of strings that map in order to the list of regs.

- hpd-gdsc-supply: phandle to the mdss gdsc regulator device tree node.
- hpd-5v-supply: phandle to the 5V regulator device tree node.
- core-vdda-supply: phandle to the HDMI vdda regulator device tree node.
- core-vcc-supply: phandle to the HDMI vcc regulator device tree node.
- qcom,supply-names: a list of strings that map in order
  to the list of supplies.
- qcom,min-voltage-level: specifies minimum voltage (uV) level
  of supply(ies) mentioned above.
- qcom,max-voltage-level: specifies maximum voltage (uV) level
  of supply(ies) mentioned above.
- qcom,enable-load: specifies the current (uA) that will be
  drawn from the enabled supply(ies) mentioned above.
- qcom,disable-load: specifies the current (uA) that will be
  drawn from the disabled supply(ies) mentioned above.

- qcom,hdmi-tx-cec: gpio for Consumer Electronics Control (cec) line.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-ddc-clk: gpio for Display Data Channel (ddc) clock line.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-ddc-data: gpio for ddc data line.

Optional properties:
- hpd-5v-en-supply: phandle to the 5V boost enable regulator device tree node.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-mux-sel: gpio required to toggle HDMI output between
  docking station, type A, and liquid device, type D, ports. Required
  property for liquid devices.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-ddc-mux-sel: gpio for ddc mux select.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-mux-en: gpio required to enable mux for HDMI output
  on liquid devices. Required property for liquid devices.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-mux-lpm: gpio required for hdmi mux configuration
  selection on liquid devices. Required property for liquid devices.
- qcom,conditional-power-on: Enables HPD conditionally on MTP targets.
  Required property for MTP devices which are reworked to expose HDMI port.
- qcom,hdmi-tx-hpd: gpio required for HDMI hot-plug detect. Required on
  platforms where companion chip is not used.
- pinctrl-names: a list of strings that map to the pinctrl states.
- pinctrl-0: list of phandles, each pointing at a pin configuration node.
...
- pinctrl-n: list of phandles, each pointing at a pin configuration node.
- qcom,conti-splash-enabled: Enables the hdmi continuous splash screen feature.
  HDMI interface will remain powered on from LK to kernel with continuous
  display of bootup logo.

[Optional child nodes]: These nodes are for devices which are
dependent on HDMI Tx controller. If HDMI Tx controller is disabled then
these devices will be disabled as well. Ex. HDMI Audio Codec device.

- qcom,msm-hdmi-audio-rx: Node for HDMI audio codec.
Required properties:
- compatible : "msm-hdmi-audio-codec-rx";
