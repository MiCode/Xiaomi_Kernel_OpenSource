* msm-qpnp-rtc

msm-qpnp-rtc is a RTC driver that supports 32 bit RTC housed inside PMIC.
Driver utilizes MSM SPMI interface to communicate with the RTC module.
RTC device is divided into two sub-peripherals one which controls basic RTC
and other for controlling alarm.

[PMIC RTC Device Declarations]

-Root Node-

Required properties :
 - compatible:		Must be "qcom,qpnp-rtc"
 - #address-cells:	The number of cells dedicated to represent an address
			This must be set to '1'.
 - #size-cells:		The number of cells dedicated to represent address
			space range of a peripheral. This must be set to '1'.

Optional properties:
 - qcom,qpnp-rtc-write:		This property enables/disables rtc write
				operation. If not mentioned rtc driver keeps
				rtc writes disabled.
				0 = Disable rtc writes.
				1 = Enable rtc writes.
 - qcom,qpnp-rtc-alarm-pwrup:	This property enables/disables feature of
				powering up phone (from power down state)
				through alarm interrupt.
				If not mentioned rtc driver will disable
				feature of powring-up phone through alarm.
				0 = Disable powering up of phone through
				alarm interrupt.
				1 = Enable powering up of phone through
				alarm interrupt.

-Child Nodes-

Required properties :
 - reg :		Specify the spmi offset and size for device.
 - interrupts:		Specifies alarm interrupt, only for rtc_alarm
			sub-peripheral.

Example:
	qcom,pm8941_rtc {
		compatible = "qcom,qpnp-rtc";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		qcom,qpnp-rtc-write = <0>;
		qcom,qpnp-rtc-alarm-pwrup = <0>;

		qcom,pm8941_rtc_rw@6000 {
			reg = <0x6000 0x100>;
		};

		qcom,pm8941_rtc_alarm@6100 {
			reg = <0x6100 0x100>;
			interrupts = <0x0 0x61 0x1>;
		};
	};
