Qualcomm CPR (Core Power Reduction) Regulator

CPR regulator device is for Qualcomm RBCPR (RapidBridge CPR) on
	application processor core. It takes voltage corner level
	as input and converts it to actual voltage based on the
	suggestions from factory production process. When CPR is
	enabled for application processer core, it will suggest
	scaling the voltage up or down for best performance and
	power of the core. The scaling based on factory production
	process is called PVS (Process Voltage Scaling) with efuse
	bits to indicate what bin (and voltage range) a chip is in.

				[1]: => LSB bit position of the bits;
				[2]: => number of the bits;
				[3]: => the value to indicate if the apc pvs voltage uplift workaround will

- qcom,cpr-uplift-voltage:	Uplift in microvolts used for increasing pvs init voltage. If this property is present,
				This is required if cpr-fuse-uplift-disable-sel is present.
- qcom,cpr-uplift-max-volt:	Maximum voltage in microvolts used for pvs voltage uplift workaround to limit
				the maximum pvs voltage.
				This is required if cpr-fuse-uplift-disable-sel is present.
- qcom,cpr-uplift-quotient:	Array of target quotient increments to add to the fused quotients of each
				fuse corner as part of the PVS voltage uplift workaround.
				The elements in the array are ordered from lowest voltage
				corner to highest voltage corner.  This property must be of
				length defined by qcom,cpr-fuse-corners.  This is required

				fuse corner.  The elements in the array are ordered from lowest voltage
				corner to highest voltage corner.  This property must be of length defined
				by qcom,cpr-fuse-corners.  If this property is specified, then the quotient
				adjustment values are added to the target quotient values read from fuses
				before writing them into the CPR GCNT target control registers.
				This property can be used to add static margin to the voltage rail managed by the CPR controller.
- qcom,cpr-clamp-timer-interval:	The number of 64 reference clock cycle blocks to delay for whenever
					the clamp signal, sensor mask registers or sensor bypass registers
					change.  The CPR controller loop is disabled during this delay.
					Supported values are 0 to 255.  If this property is not specified,
					then a value of 0 is assumed.  Note that if this property has a
					value greater than 0, then software cannot accurately determine the
					error_steps value that corresponds to a given CPR measurement
					unless processor power collapsing is disabled.  If this property
					has a value of 0, then the CPR controller loop is not disabled and
					re-enabled while idle if the clamp signal changes.  Instead, it
					will remain idle until software issues an ACK or NACK command.
					This ensures that software can read the error_steps value which
					resulted in the CPR up or down interrupt.  Setting this property to
					a value greater than 0 is useful for resetting the CPR sensors of a
					processor that uses BHS type voltage switches in order to avoid
					anomalous CPR up interrupts when exiting from power collapse.
- vdd-apc-optional-prim-supply:	Present: Regulator of highest priority to supply VDD APC power
				Not Present: No such regulator.

				[0]: =>		the speed bin of the CPU.
				[1]: =>		the PVS version of the CPU. If device does't have PVS version fuse,
						set the value to 0.
				[2 - N+1]: =>	the max virtual voltage corner value corresponding each fuse corner
						for this speed bin ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest
						voltage corner.
				No CPR target quotient scaling is applied on chips which have a speed bin + PVS version
				pair that does not appear in one of the tuples in this property. If the property is
				specified, then quotient scaling is enabled for the highest voltage corner. If this property is
				not specified, then no quotient scaling can take place.
- qcom,cpr-corner-map:		Array of elements of fuse corner value for each virtual corner.
				The location or 1-based index of an element in the list corresponds to

				calculating the quotient adjustment for a given virtual voltage corner. It
				corresponds to 'scaling' in this equation:
				quot_adjust = (freq_max - freq_corner) * scaling / 1000.
				This property is required if qcom,cpr-speed-bin-max-corners is present.
- qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage:	Array of quadruples in which each quadruple specifies a fuse location to
				read in order to get an initial voltage for a fuse corner. The fuse values
