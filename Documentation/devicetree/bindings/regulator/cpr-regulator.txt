Qualcomm CPR (Core Power Reduction) Regulator

CPR regulator device is for Qualcomm RBCPR (RapidBridge CPR) on
	application processor core. It takes voltage corner level
	as input and converts it to actual voltage based on the
	suggestions from factory production process. When CPR is
	enabled for application processer core, it will suggest
	scaling the voltage up or down for best performance and
	power of the core. The scaling based on factory production
	process is called PVS (Process Voltage Scaling) with efuse
	bits to indicate what bin (and voltage range) a chip is in.

				The doubles in the array are ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest
				voltage corner.  This property must contain a number of doubles equal to
				the value of qcom,cpr-fuse-corners.  If this property is not present,
				then all target quotient parameters are assumed to have an offset of 0
				and a multiplier of 1 (i.e. no decoding needed).
- qcom,cpr-enable:		Present: CPR enabled by default.
				Not Present: CPR disable by default.
- qcom,cpr-fuse-cond-min-volt-sel:	Array of 5 elements to indicate where to read the bits,  what value to

				fuse parameter values.  Each tuple consists of N + 3 elements.  Where

				property.  The elements in one tuple are:
				[0]: =>		the speed bin of the CPU
				[1]: =>		the PVS version of the CPU
				[2]: =>		the CPR fuse revision
				[3 - N+2]: =>	the ring oscillator select value of each fuse corner
						ordered from lowest to highest
				Any element in a tuple may use the value 0xffffffff as a wildcard
				which will match against any fuse parameter value.  The first tuple
				that matches against the fuse values read from hardware will be used.
				This property is used by several properties to provide an index into
				their lists.
- qcom,cpr-quotient-adjustment:	Array of integer tuples of target quotient adjustments to add to the fused
				quotients of each fuse corner.  The elements in a tuple are ordered from
				lowest voltage corner to highest voltage corner.  Each tuple must be of
				length defined by qcom,cpr-fuse-corners.  If the qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map
				property is specified, then qcom,cpr-quotient-adjustment must contain the
				same number of tuples as qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map.  These tuples are then
				mapped one-to-one in the order specified.  E.g. if the second
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map tuple matches for a given device, then the quotient
				adjustments defined in the second qcom,cpr-quotient-adjustment tuple will
				be applied.  If the qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is not specified,
				then qcom,cpr-quotient-adjustment must contain a single tuple which is then
				applied unconditionally.  If this property is specified, then the quotient
				adjustment values are added to the target quotient values read from fuses
				before writing them into the CPR GCNT target control registers.
				This property can be used to add or subtract static voltage margin from the
				regulator managed by the CPR controller.
- qcom,cpr-init-voltage-adjustment:  Array of integer tuples of initial voltage adjustments in microvolts to
				add to the fused initial voltage values of each fuse corner.  The elements
				in a tuple are ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest voltage corner.
				Each tuple must be of the length defined by qcom,cpr-fuse-corners.  If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is specified, then
				qcom,cpr-init-voltage-adjustment must contain the same number of tuples as
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map.  These tuples are then mapped one-to-one in the
				order specified.  E.g. if the second qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map tuple matches
				for a given device, then the initial voltage adjustments defined in the
				second qcom,cpr-init-voltage-adjustment tuple will be applied.  If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is not specified, then
				qcom,cpr-init-voltage-adjustment must contain a single tuple which is then
				applied unconditionally.  This property can be used to add or subtract
				static initial voltage margin from the regulator managed by the CPR
				controller.
- qcom,cpr-clamp-timer-interval:	The number of 64 reference clock cycle blocks to delay for whenever
					the clamp signal, sensor mask registers or sensor bypass registers
					change.  The CPR controller loop is disabled during this delay.
					Supported values are 0 to 255.  If this property is not specified,
					then a value of 0 is assumed.  Note that if this property has a
					value greater than 0, then software cannot accurately determine the
					error_steps value that corresponds to a given CPR measurement
					unless processor power collapsing is disabled.  If this property
					has a value of 0, then the CPR controller loop is not disabled and
					re-enabled while idle if the clamp signal changes.  Instead, it
					will remain idle until software issues an ACK or NACK command.
					This ensures that software can read the error_steps value which
					resulted in the CPR up or down interrupt.  Setting this property to
					a value greater than 0 is useful for resetting the CPR sensors of a
					processor that uses BHS type voltage switches in order to avoid
					anomalous CPR up interrupts when exiting from power collapse.
- vdd-apc-optional-prim-supply:	Present: Regulator of highest priority to supply VDD APC power
				Not Present: No such regulator.

- qcom,cpr-speed-bin-max-corners: Array of (N+2)-tuples in which each tuple maps a CPU speed bin and PVS version to
				the maximum virtual voltage corner corresponding to each fuse corner.  The value N
				corresponds to the number of fuse corners specified by qcom,cpr-fuse-corners.
				The elements in one tuple are:
				[0]: =>		the speed bin of the CPU. If the device doesn't have a speed bin,
						fuse, then set the value to 0xFFFFFFFF.
				[1]: =>		the PVS version of the CPU. If the device doesn't have a PVS version
						fuse, then set the value to 0.
				[2 - N+1]: =>	the max virtual voltage corner value corresponding to each fuse corner
						for this speed bin, ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest
						voltage corner.
				No CPR target quotient scaling is applied on chips which have a speed bin + PVS version
				pair that does not appear in one of the tuples in this property. If the property is
				specified, then quotient scaling is enabled for the highest voltage corner. If this property is
				not specified, then no quotient scaling can take place.
- qcom,cpr-corner-map:		Array of elements of fuse corner value for each virtual corner.
				The location or 1-based index of an element in the list corresponds to
				the virtual corner value. For example, the first element in the list is the fuse corner
				value that virtual corner 1 maps to.
				This property is required if qcom,cpr-speed-bin-max-corners is present.
- qcom,cpr-corner-frequency-map: Array of tuples in which a tuple describes a corner to application processor frequency
				mapping.

- qcom,cpr-voltage-ceiling-override: Array of (N+2)-tuples in which each tuple maps a CPU speed bin and PVS version
				to the ceiling voltage to apply for each virtual voltage corner.  The value N
				corresponds to the number of virtual corners as specified by the number of elements
				in the qcom,cpr-corner-map property.
				The elements in one tuple are:
				[0]: =>		the speed bin of the CPU. If the device doesn't have a speed bin
						fuse, then set the value to 0xFFFFFFFF.
				[1]: =>		the PVS version of the CPU. If the device doesn't have a PVS version
						fuse, then set the value to 0.
				[2 - N+1]: =>	the ceiling voltage value in microvolts corresponding to each virtual
						corner for this speed bin, ordered from lowest voltage corner to
						highest voltage corner.
				No ceiling override is applied on chips which have a speed bin + PVS version
				pair that does not appear in one of the tuples in this property.  If the property is
				specified and the speed bin + PVS version matches, then the per-virtual-corner ceiling
				voltages will be used in place of the per-fuse-corner ceiling voltages defined in the
				qcom,cpr-voltage-ceiling property.  If this property is not specified, then the
				per-fuse-corner ceiling voltages will always be used.
- qcom,cpr-voltage-floor-override: Array of (N+2)-tuples in which each tuple maps a CPU speed bin and PVS version
				to the floor voltage to apply for each virtual voltage corner.  The value N
				corresponds to the number of virtual corners as specified by the number of elements
				in the qcom,cpr-corner-map property.
				The elements in one tuple are:
				[0]: =>		the speed bin of the CPU. If the device doesn't have a speed bin
						fuse, then set the value to 0xFFFFFFFF.
				[1]: =>		the PVS version of the CPU. If the device doesn't have a PVS version
						fuse, then set the value to 0.
				[2 - N+1]: =>	the floor voltage value in microvolts corresponding to each virtual
						corner for this speed bin, ordered from lowest voltage corner to
						highest voltage corner.
				No floor override is applied on chips which have a speed bin + PVS version
				pair that does not appear in one of the tuples in this property.  If the property is
				specified and the speed bin + PVS version matches, then the per-virtual-corner floor
				voltages will be used in place of the per-fuse-corner floor voltages defined in the
				qcom,cpr-voltage-floor property.  If this property is not specified, then the
				per-fuse-corner floor voltages will always be used.
- qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-init-voltage-adjustment: Array of integer tuples of voltage adjustments in microvolts to be
				added to the initial voltage values of each virtual corner.  The elements
				in a tuple are ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest voltage corner.
				Each tuple must be of the length equal to the number of virtual corners as
				specified by the number of elements in the qcom,cpr-corner-map property. If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is specified, then
				qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-init-voltage-adjustment must contain the same number of
				tuples as qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map.  These tuples are then mapped one-to-one in the
				order specified.  E.g. if the second qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map tuple matches
				for a given device, then voltage adjustments defined in the second
				qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-init-voltage-adjustment tuple will be applied.  If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is not specified, then
				qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-init-voltage-adjustment must contain a single tuple which
				is then applied unconditionally.
- qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-quotient-adjustment: Array of integer tuples of quotient offsets to be added to
				the scaled target quotient of each virtual corner. The elements
				in a tuple are ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest voltage corner.
				Each tuple must be of the length equal to the number of virtual corners as
				specified by the number of elements in the qcom,cpr-corner-map property.
				If the qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is specified, then
				qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-quotient-adjustment must contain the same number of tuples as
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map.  These tuples are then mapped one-to-one in the
				order specified.  E.g. if the second qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map tuple matches
				for a given device, then quotient adjustments defined in the second
				qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-quotient-adjustment tuple will be applied.  If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is not specified, then
				qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-quotient-adjustment must contain a single tuple which is then
				applied unconditionally.
- qcom,cpr-init-voltage-as-ceiling: Boolean which indicates that the ceiling voltage used for a given virtual
				corner may be reduced to the per-fuse-corner initial voltage fuse value.
- qcom,cpr-scaled-init-voltage-as-ceiling: Boolean which indicates that the ceiling voltage used for a given
				virtual corner may be reduced to the interpolated, per-virtual-corner initial
				voltage value.  Note that if both qcom,cpr-init-voltage-as-ceiling and
				qcom,cpr-scaled-init-voltage-as-ceiling are specified, then
				qcom,cpr-scaled-init-voltage-as-ceiling will take precedence since the interpolated
				voltages are necessarily less than or equal to the fused initial voltage values.
- qcom,cpr-voltage-scaling-factor-max: Array of values which define the maximum allowed scaling factor to apply
				when calculating per-corner initial voltage values for each fuse corner.  The
				array must be of length equal to the value of the qcom,cpr-fuse-corners property.
				Each element in the array maps to the fuse corners in increasing order.
				The elements have units of uV/MHz.  Each element corresponds to 'max_factor' in
				the following equation:
				init_voltage_min(f) = fuse_init_voltage(f) - (fuse_f_max - f) * max_factor
				If this property is not specified, then the initial voltage for each virtual
				corner will be set to the initial voltage of the associated fuse corner.
- qcom,cpr-quot-adjust-scaling-factor-max: Array of values which define the maximum allowed scaling factor to
				apply when calculating per-virtual-corner target quotients for each fuse
				corner.  Two data formats are allowed for this property.  The primary one
				requires that the array be of length equal to the value of the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-corners property.  When using this format, each element in the
				array maps to the fuse corners in increasing order.  The second depreciated
				format allows for only a single element to be specified which defines the
				maximum scaling factor for the highest fuse corner.  In this case, a value of
				0 is assumed for the lower fuse corners.  The elements of this property have
				units of QUOT/GHz.  Each element corresponds to 'max_factor' in the following
				equation:
				quot_min(f) = fuse_quot(f) - (fuse_f_max - f) * max_factor / 1000
				where f and fuse_f_max have units of MHz.
				This property is required if qcom,cpr-speed-bin-max-corners is present.
- qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage:	Array of quadruples in which each quadruple specifies a fuse location to
				read in order to get an initial voltage for a fuse corner. The fuse values
				are encoded as voltage steps higher or lower than the voltages defined in
				qcom,cpr-voltage-ceiling. Each step corresponds to the voltage defined by
				the qcom,cpr-init-voltage-step property.
				The 4 elements in one quadruple are:
				[0]: => the fuse row number of the bits
				[1]: => LSB bit position of the bits
				[2]: => number of the bits
				[3]: => fuse reading method, 0 for direct reading or 1 for SCM reading
				The quadruples are ordered from the lowest voltage fuse corner to the
				highest voltage fuse corner.
				A given cpr-regulator device must have either qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage
				specified or qcom,pvs-voltage-table (and its associated properties).
- qcom,cpr-fuse-redun-init-voltage: Array of quadruples in which each quadruple specifies a fuse location
				to read in order to get the redundant initial voltage for a fuse corner.
				This property is the same as qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage except that it is
				only utilized if a chip is configured to use the redundant set of fuse
				values.  This property is required if qcom,cpr-fuse-redun-sel and
				qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage are specified.
- qcom,cpr-init-voltage-ref:	Array of reference voltages in microvolts used when decoding the initial
				voltage fuse values.  The elements in the array are ordered from lowest
				voltage corner to highest voltage corner.  This property must be of length
				defined by qcom,cpr-fuse-corners.
				This property is required if qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage is present.
- qcom,cpr-init-voltage-step:	The voltage step size in microvolts of the CPR initial voltage fuses described by the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage property.
				This property is required if qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage is present.
- mem-acc-supply:		Regulator to vote for the memory accelerator configuration.
				Not Present: memory accelerator configuration not supported.
- qcom,fuse-remap-source:	Array of quadruples in which each quadruple specifies a fuse location to
				remap.  The 4 elements in one quadruple are:
				[0]: => the fuse row number of the bits
				[1]: => LSB bit position of the bits
				[2]: => the number of bits
				[3]: => fuse reading method, 0 for direct reading or 1 for SCM reading
				The fuse bits for all quadruples are packed together in the order specified
				into 64-bit virtual fuse rows beginning at the row number defined in the
				qcom,fuse-remap-base-row property.  The remapped rows may be used by any
				other properties.
				Example:
					qcom,fuse-remap-base-row = <1000>;
					qcom,fuse-remap-source =
							<13 57 2 0>,
							<14 30 3 0>,
							<20 1 7 0>,
							<40 47 120 0>;

					This results in the following bit remapping:

					Row   Bits       Remap Row  Remap Bits
					13    57..58  -->  1000      0..1
					14    30..32  -->  1000      2..4
					20     1..7   -->  1000      5..11
					40    47..63  -->  1000     12..28
					41     0..34  -->  1000     29..63
					41    35..63  -->  1001      0..28
					42     0..34  -->  1001     29..63
					42    35..38  -->  1002      0..3

					A tuple like this could then be used to reference some of the
					concatenated bits from rows 13, 14, and 20:

					qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage = <1000 0 6 0>;
- qcom,fuse-remap-base-row:	Integer which defines the virtual row number to use as a base when remapping
				fuse bits.  The remap base row number can be any value as long as it is
				greater than all of the real row numbers addressed in other properties of
				the cpr-regulator device node.  This property is required if
				qcom,fuse-remap-source is specified.
