QTI CPR (Core Power Reduction) Regulator

CPR regulator device is for QTI RBCPR (RapidBridge CPR) on
	application processor core. It takes voltage corner level
	as input and converts it to actual voltage based on the
	suggestions from factory production process. When CPR is
	enabled for application processer core, it will suggest
	scaling the voltage up or down for best performance and
	power of the core. The scaling based on factory production
	process is called PVS (Process Voltage Scaling) with efuse
	bits to indicate what bin (and voltage range) a chip is in.

				for a particular fuse revision, then the closed loop operation is enabled
				for that fuse revision by default.

				quotients of each fuse corner.  The elements in a tuple are ordered from

				property is specified, then qcom,cpr-quotient-adjustment must contain the
				same number of tuples as qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map.  These tuples are then
				mapped one-to-one in the order specified.  E.g. if the second
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map tuple matches for a given device, then the quotient
				adjustments defined in the second qcom,cpr-quotient-adjustment tuple will
				be applied.  If the qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is not specified,
				then qcom,cpr-quotient-adjustment must contain a single tuple which is then
				applied unconditionally.  If this property is specified, then the quotient
				adjustment values are added to the target quotient values read from fuses
				before writing them into the CPR GCNT target control registers.
				This property can be used to add or subtract static voltage margin from the
				regulator managed by the CPR controller.
- qcom,cpr-init-voltage-adjustment:  Array of integer tuples of initial voltage adjustments in microvolts to
				add to the fused initial voltage values of each fuse corner.  The elements
				in a tuple are ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest voltage corner.
				Each tuple must be of the length defined by qcom,cpr-fuse-corners.  If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is specified, then
				qcom,cpr-init-voltage-adjustment must contain the same number of tuples as
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map.  These tuples are then mapped one-to-one in the
				order specified.  E.g. if the second qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map tuple matches
				for a given device, then the initial voltage adjustments defined in the
				second qcom,cpr-init-voltage-adjustment tuple will be applied.  If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is not specified, then
				qcom,cpr-init-voltage-adjustment must contain a single tuple which is then
				applied unconditionally.  This property can be used to add or subtract
				static initial voltage margin from the regulator managed by the CPR
				controller.
- qcom,cpr-quot-offset-adjustment:	Array of integer tuples of target quotient offset adjustments to add
				to the fused quotient offsets of each fuse corner. The elements in a tuple
				are ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest voltage corner. Each tuple
				must be of length defined by qcom,cpr-fuse-corners. If the qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map
				property is specified, then qcom,cpr-quot-offset-adjustment must contain the
				same number of tuples as qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map.  These tuples are then
				mapped one-to-one in the order specified.  E.g. if the second
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map tuple matches for a given device, then the quotient
				offset adjustments defined in the second qcom,cpr-quot-offset-adjustment tuple
				will be applied. If the qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is not specified,
				then qcom,cpr-quot-offset-adjustment must contain a single tuple which is then
				applied unconditionally.  If this property is specified, then the quotient
				offset adjustment values are added to the target quotient offset values read
				from fuses.
				This property can be used to add or subtract static quotient offset margin from
				the regulator managed by the CPR controller.
- qcom,cpr-clamp-timer-interval:	The number of 64 reference clock cycle blocks to delay for whenever
					the clamp signal, sensor mask registers or sensor bypass registers
					change.  The CPR controller loop is disabled during this delay.
					Supported values are 0 to 255.  If this property is not specified,
					then a value of 0 is assumed.  Note that if this property has a
					value greater than 0, then software cannot accurately determine the
					error_steps value that corresponds to a given CPR measurement
					unless processor power collapsing is disabled.  If this property
					has a value of 0, then the CPR controller loop is not disabled and
					re-enabled while idle if the clamp signal changes.  Instead, it
					will remain idle until software issues an ACK or NACK command.
					This ensures that software can read the error_steps value which
					resulted in the CPR up or down interrupt.  Setting this property to
					a value greater than 0 is useful for resetting the CPR sensors of a
					processor that uses BHS type voltage switches in order to avoid
					anomalous CPR up interrupts when exiting from power collapse.

				No CPR target quotient scaling is applied on chips which have a speed bin + PVS version
				pair that does not appear in one of the tuples in this property. If the property is

				The elements in one tuple are:

						wildcard to match any PVS version values.
				[2 - N+1]: =>	the ceiling voltage value in microvolts corresponding to each virtual
						corner for this speed bin, ordered from lowest voltage corner to
						highest voltage corner.
				No ceiling override is applied on chips which have a speed bin + PVS version
				pair that does not appear in one of the tuples in this property.  If the property is
				specified and the speed bin + PVS version matches, then the per-virtual-corner ceiling
				voltages will be used in place of the per-fuse-corner ceiling voltages defined in the

						wildcard to match any PVS version values.
				[2 - N+1]: =>	the floor voltage value in microvolts corresponding to each virtual
						corner for this speed bin, ordered from lowest voltage corner to
						highest voltage corner.
				No floor override is applied on chips which have a speed bin + PVS version
				pair that does not appear in one of the tuples in this property.  If the property is
				specified and the speed bin + PVS version matches, then the per-virtual-corner floor
				voltages will be used in place of the per-fuse-corner floor voltages defined in the
				qcom,cpr-voltage-floor property.  If this property is not specified, then the
				per-fuse-corner floor voltages will always be used.
- qcom,cpr-floor-to-ceiling-max-range:	Array of integer tuples of floor-to-ceiling max range values in microvolts
				to be subtracted from the ceiling voltage values of each virtual corner.
				Supported values are those greater than or equal 0, or (-1). The value 0 for a corner
				implies that the floor value for that corner has to equal to its ceiling value.
				The value (-1) for a corner implies that no modification to the default floor voltage
				is required. The elements in a tuple are ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest
				voltage corner. Each tuple must be of the length equal to the number of virtual corners
				as specified by the number of elements in the qcom,cpr-corner-map property. If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is specified, then
				qcom,cpr-dynamic-floor-override-adjustment must contain the same number of
				tuples as qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map.  These tuples are then mapped one-to-one in the
				order specified.  E.g. if the second qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map tuple matches
				for a given device, then voltage adjustments defined in the second
				qcom,cpr-dynamic-floor-override-adjustment tuple will be applied.  If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is not specified, then

				is then applied unconditionally.
- qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-init-voltage-adjustment: Array of integer tuples of voltage adjustments in microvolts to be
				added to the initial voltage values of each virtual corner.  The elements
				in a tuple are ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest voltage corner.
				Each tuple must be of the length equal to the number of virtual corners as
				specified by the number of elements in the qcom,cpr-corner-map property. If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is specified, then
				qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-init-voltage-adjustment must contain the same number of
				tuples as qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map.  These tuples are then mapped one-to-one in the
				order specified.  E.g. if the second qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map tuple matches
				for a given device, then voltage adjustments defined in the second
				qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-init-voltage-adjustment tuple will be applied.  If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is not specified, then
				qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-init-voltage-adjustment must contain a single tuple which
				is then applied unconditionally.
- qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-quotient-adjustment: Array of integer tuples of quotient offsets to be added to
				the scaled target quotient of each virtual corner. The elements
				in a tuple are ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest voltage corner.
				Each tuple must be of the length equal to the number of virtual corners as
				specified by the number of elements in the qcom,cpr-corner-map property.
				If the qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is specified, then
				qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-quotient-adjustment must contain the same number of tuples as
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map.  These tuples are then mapped one-to-one in the
				order specified.  E.g. if the second qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map tuple matches
				for a given device, then quotient adjustments defined in the second
				qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-quotient-adjustment tuple will be applied.  If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is not specified, then
				qcom,cpr-virtual-corner-quotient-adjustment must contain a single tuple which is then
				applied unconditionally.
- qcom,cpr-cpus:		Array of CPU phandles which correspond to the cores that this cpr-regulator
				device must monitor when adjusting the voltage and/or target quotient based
				upon the number of online cores or make sure that one of them must be online
				when performing de-aging measurements. This property must be specified in order to
				utilize the qcom,cpr-online-cpu-virtual-corner-init-voltage-adjustment or
				qcom,cpr-online-cpu-virtual-corner-quotient-adjustment or qcom,cpr-aging-sensor-id properties.
- qcom,cpr-online-cpu-virtual-corner-init-voltage-adjustment:	Array of tuples where each tuple specifies
				the voltage adjustment for each corner. These adjustments apply to the
				initial voltage of each corner. The size of each tuple must be equal
				to qcom,cpr-fuse-corners if consumers request fuse corners or the length of
				qcom,cpr-corner-map if consumers request virtual corners. In each tuple, the
				value corresponds to the voltage adjustment when running at that corner at
				init, from lowest to highest. The tuples must be organized into 1 group if
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map is not specified or the same number of groups as
				the number of tuples in qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map. The i-th group of tuples
				corresponds to the voltage adjustments for i-th fuse version map tuple. In
				each group, there are 1 plus length of qcom,cpr-cpus tuples, each tuple
				corresponds to the number of cores online, from 0 to the number of elements
				in qcom,cpr-cpus.
- qcom,cpr-online-cpu-init-voltage-as-ceiling:	Boolean which indicates that the ceiling voltage used for a
				given virtual corner may be reduced to the per number of cores online,
				per-virtual corner ceiling voltage value. This property takes precedence
				over qcom,cpr-scaled-init-voltage-as-ceiling if both are specified.
- qcom,cpr-online-cpu-virtual-corner-quotient-adjustment:	Array of tuples where each tuple specifies
				the quotient adjustment for each corner. These adjustments will be applied
				to each corner at run time. The size of each tuple must be equal to
				qcom,cpr-fuse-corners if consumers request fuse corners or the length of
				qcom,cpr-corner-map if consumers request virtual corners. In each tuple,
				the value corresponds to the quotient adjustment when running at that corner,
				from lowest to highest. The tuples must be organized into 1 group if
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map is not specified or the same number of groups
				as the number of tuples in qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map. The i-th group of
				tuples corresponds to the quotient adjustments for i-th fuse version map
				tuple. In each group, there are 1 plus length of qcom,cpr-cpus tuples,
				each tuple corresponds to the number of cores online, from 0 to the
				number of elements in qcom,cpr-cpus.
- qcom,cpr-init-voltage-as-ceiling: Boolean which indicates that the ceiling voltage used for a given virtual
				corner may be reduced to the per-fuse-corner initial voltage fuse value.
- qcom,cpr-scaled-init-voltage-as-ceiling: Boolean which indicates that the ceiling voltage used for a given
				virtual corner may be reduced to the interpolated, per-virtual-corner initial
				voltage value.  Note that if both qcom,cpr-init-voltage-as-ceiling and
				qcom,cpr-scaled-init-voltage-as-ceiling are specified, then
				qcom,cpr-scaled-init-voltage-as-ceiling will take precedence since the interpolated
				voltages are necessarily less than or equal to the fused initial voltage values.
- qcom,cpr-voltage-scaling-factor-max: Array of values which define the maximum allowed scaling factor to apply
				when calculating per-corner initial voltage values for each fuse corner.  The
				array must be of length equal to the value of the qcom,cpr-fuse-corners property.
				Each element in the array maps to the fuse corners in increasing order.
				The elements have units of uV/MHz.  Each element corresponds to 'max_factor' in
				the following equation:
				init_voltage_min(f) = fuse_init_voltage(f) - (fuse_f_max - f) * max_factor
				If this property is not specified, then the initial voltage for each virtual
				corner will be set to the initial voltage of the associated fuse corner.
- qcom,cpr-quot-adjust-scaling-factor-max: Array of values which define the maximum allowed scaling factor to
				apply when calculating per-virtual-corner target quotients for each fuse
				corner.  Two data formats are allowed for this property.  The primary one
				requires that the array be of length equal to the value of the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-corners property.  When using this format, each element in the
				array maps to the fuse corners in increasing order.  The second depreciated
				format allows for only a single element to be specified which defines the
				maximum scaling factor for the highest fuse corner.  In this case, a value of
				0 is assumed for the lower fuse corners.  The elements of this property have
				units of QUOT/GHz.  Each element corresponds to 'max_factor' in the following
				equation:
				quot_min(f) = fuse_quot(f) - (fuse_f_max - f) * max_factor / 1000
				where f and fuse_f_max have units of MHz.
				This property is required if qcom,cpr-speed-bin-max-corners is present.
- qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage:	Array of quadruples in which each quadruple specifies a fuse location to
				read in order to get an initial voltage for a fuse corner. The fuse values
				are encoded as voltage steps higher or lower than the voltages defined in
				qcom,cpr-voltage-ceiling. Each step corresponds to the voltage defined by
				the qcom,cpr-init-voltage-step property.
				The 4 elements in one quadruple are:
				[0]: => the fuse row number of the bits
				[1]: => LSB bit position of the bits
				[2]: => number of the bits
				[3]: => fuse reading method, 0 for direct reading or 1 for SCM reading
				The quadruples are ordered from the lowest voltage fuse corner to the
				highest voltage fuse corner.
				A given cpr-regulator device must have either qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage
				specified or qcom,pvs-voltage-table (and its associated properties).
- qcom,cpr-fuse-redun-init-voltage: Array of quadruples in which each quadruple specifies a fuse location
				to read in order to get the redundant initial voltage for a fuse corner.
				This property is the same as qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage except that it is
				only utilized if a chip is configured to use the redundant set of fuse
				values.  This property is required if qcom,cpr-fuse-redun-sel and
				qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage are specified.
- qcom,cpr-init-voltage-ref:	Array of reference voltages in microvolts used when decoding the initial
				voltage fuse values.  The elements in the array are ordered from lowest
				voltage corner to highest voltage corner.  This property must be of length
				defined by qcom,cpr-fuse-corners.
				This property is required if qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage is present.
- qcom,cpr-init-voltage-step:	The voltage step size in microvolts of the CPR initial voltage fuses described by the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage property.
				This property is required if qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage is present.
- mem-acc-supply:		Regulator to vote for the memory accelerator configuration.
				Not Present: memory accelerator configuration not supported.
- qcom,mem-acc-corner-map:	Array of integer which defines the mapping from mem-acc corner value for each
				virtual corner. Each element is a mem-acc state for the corresponding virtual corner.
				The elements in the array are ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest voltage corner.
- qcom,fuse-remap-source:	Array of quadruples in which each quadruple specifies a fuse location to
				remap.  The 4 elements in one quadruple are:
				[0]: => the fuse row number of the bits
				[1]: => LSB bit position of the bits
				[2]: => the number of bits
				[3]: => fuse reading method, 0 for direct reading or 1 for SCM reading
				The fuse bits for all quadruples are packed together in the order specified
				into 64-bit virtual fuse rows beginning at the row number defined in the
				qcom,fuse-remap-base-row property.  The remapped rows may be used by any
				other properties.
				Example:
					qcom,fuse-remap-base-row = <1000>;
					qcom,fuse-remap-source =
							<13 57 2 0>,
							<14 30 3 0>,
							<20 1 7 0>,
							<40 47 120 0>;

					This results in the following bit remapping:

					Row   Bits       Remap Row  Remap Bits
					13    57..58  -->  1000      0..1
					14    30..32  -->  1000      2..4
					20     1..7   -->  1000      5..11
					40    47..63  -->  1000     12..28
					41     0..34  -->  1000     29..63
					41    35..63  -->  1001      0..28
					42     0..34  -->  1001     29..63
					42    35..38  -->  1002      0..3

					A tuple like this could then be used to reference some of the
					concatenated bits from rows 13, 14, and 20:

					qcom,cpr-fuse-init-voltage = <1000 0 6 0>;
- qcom,fuse-remap-base-row:	Integer which defines the virtual row number to use as a base when remapping
				fuse bits.  The remap base row number can be any value as long as it is
				greater than all of the real row numbers addressed in other properties of
				the cpr-regulator device node.  This property is required if
				qcom,fuse-remap-source is specified.
- qcom,cpr-quot-min-diff:	Integer which defines the minimum target-quotient difference between
				the highest and (highest - 1) fuse corner to keep CPR enabled. If this
				property is not specified a default value of 50 is used.
- qcom,cpr-fuse-quot-offset:	Array of quadruples in which each quadruple specifies a fuse location to
				read in order to get the quotient offset for a fuse corner. The fuse values
				are encoded as the difference between quotients of that fuse corner and its
				adjacent lower fuse corner divided by an unpacking multiplier value defined
				under qcom,cpr-fuse-quot-offset-scale property.
				The 4 elements in one quadruple are:
				[0]: => the fuse row number of the bits
				[1]: => LSB bit position of the bits
				[2]: => number of the bits
				[3]: => fuse reading method, 0 for direct reading or 1 for SCM reading
				The quadruples are ordered from the lowest fuse corner to the highest
				fuse corner.
				Quotient offset read from the fuse locations above can be overridden with
				the property qcom,cpr-quot-adjust-scaling-factor-max.
- qcom,cpr-fuse-quot-offset-scale:	Array of integer values which defines the multipliers to decode the quotient offsets
				of each fuse corner. The elements in the array are ordered from the lowest voltage fuse corner
				to the highest voltage fuse corner. If this property is not present, then all target quotient
				parameters are assumed to have a multiplier of 1 (i.e. no decoding needed).
- qcom,cpr-redun-fuse-quot-offset: Array of quadruples in which each quadruple specifies a fuse location to
				read in order to get the redundant quotient offset for a fuse corner. This
				property is the same as qcom,cpr-fuse-quot-offset except that it is only
				utilized if a chip is configured to use the redundant set of fuse values.
- qcom,cpr-fuse-min-quot-diff:	Array of values which define the minimum difference allowed between the adjusted
				quotients of the fuse corners. The length of the array should be equal to the value
				of the qcom,cpr-fuse-corners property. Where each element in the array maps to the
				fuse corners in increasing order.
- qcom,cpr-min-quot-diff-adjustment:	Array of integer tuples of target quotient offsets to be added to
				the adjusted target quotients of each fuse corner. When the quotient difference
				between two adjacent fuse corners is insufficient, the quotient for the higher fuse corner is
				replaced with that of the lower fuse corner plus the adjustment value.
				The elements in a tuple are ordered from lowest voltage corner to highest voltage corner.
				Each tuple must be of the length defined by qcom,cpr-fuse-corners.
				If the qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is specified, then qcom,cpr-min-quot-diff-adjustment
				must contain the same number of tuples as qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map.  These tuples are then mapped
				one-to-one in the order specified.  E.g. if the second qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map tuple matches
				for a given device, then the quotient adjustments defined in the
				second qcom,cpr-min-quot-diff-adjustment tuple will be applied.  If the
				qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map property is not specified, then
				qcom,cpr-min-quot-diff-adjustment must contain a single tuple which is then
				applied unconditionally. The qcom,cpr-min-quot-diff-adjustment property must be specified
				if the qcom,cpr-fuse-min-quot-diff property is specified.
- qcom,cpr-skip-voltage-change-during-suspend: Boolean property which indicates that the CPR voltage
				should not be adjusted based upon the number of online cores while
				entering or exiting system suspend.
- rpm-apc-supply:		Regulator to notify RPM of the APC operating
				corner
- qcom,rpm-apc-corner-map:	Array of integers which define the mapping of
				the RPM corner to the corresponding APC virtual
				corner. This property must be defined if
				'rpm-apc-supply' is present.

				corresponding APC fuse corner. The qcom,vsens-corner-map and
				vdd-vsense-corner-supply properties must both be specified for a given
				cpr-regulator device or neither must be specified.
- vdd-vsens-corner-supply:	Regulator to specify the current operating fuse corner to the Voltage Sensor.
- vdd-vsens-voltage-supply:	Regulator to specify the corner floor/ceiling voltages to the Voltage Sensor.
- qcom,cpr-aging-sensor-id:	Array of CPR sensor IDs to be used in the CPR de-aging algorithm. The number
				of values should be equal to number of sensors selected for age calibration.
				If this property is not specified, then the de-aging procedure is not enabled.
- qcom,cpr-de-aging-allowed:	Integer values that specify whether the CPR de-aging procedure is allowed or
				not for a particular fuse revision. If the qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map
				property is specified, then qcom,cpr-de-aging-allowed must contain the same number
				of elements as there are tuples in qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map. If qcom,cpr-fuse-version-map
				is not specified, then qcom,cpr-de-aging-allowed must contain a single value that
				is used unconditionally. An element value of 1 means that the CPR de-aging procedure
				can be performed for parts with the corresponding fuse revision. An element value of 0
				means that CPR de-aging cannot be performed.
				This property is required if the qcom,cpr-aging-sensor-id property has been specified.
- qcom,cpr-aging-ref-corner:	The vdd-apc-supply reference virtual voltage corner to be set during the CPR de-aging
				measurements. This corner value is needed to set appropriate voltage on
				the dependent voltage rails such as vdd-mx and mem-acc.
				This property is required if the qcom,cpr-aging-sensor-id property has been specified.
- qcom,cpr-aging-ref-voltage:	The vdd-apc-supply reference voltage in microvolts to be set during the
				CPR de-aging measurements.

- qcom,cpr-max-aging-margin:	The maximum allowed aging voltage margin in microvolts. This is used to limit
				the calculated aging voltage margin.
				This property is required if the qcom,cpr-aging-sensor-id property has been specified.
- qcom,cpr-non-collapsible-sensors: Array of CPR sensor IDs which are in non-collapsible domain. The sensor IDs not
				specified in the array should be bypassed for the de-aging procedure. The number of
				elements should be less than or equal to 32. The values of the array elements should
				be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 31.
				This property is required if the qcom,cpr-aging-sensor-id property has been specified.
- qcom,cpr-aging-ro-scaling-factor:	The aging ring oscillator (RO) scaling factor with units of QUOT/V.
				This value is used for calculating a voltage margin from RO measurements.
				This property is required if the qcom,cpr-aging-sensor-id property has been specified.
- qcom,cpr-ro-scaling-factor:	Array of scaling factors with units of QUOT/V for each ring oscillator ordered
				from the lowest to the highest RO. These values are used to calculate
				the aging voltage margin adjustment for all of the ROs. Since CPR2 supports
				exactly 8 ROs, the array must contain 8 elements corresponding to RO0 through RO7 in order.
				If a given RO is unused for a fuse corner, then its scaling factor may be specified as 0.
				This property is required if the qcom,cpr-aging-sensor-id property has been specified.
- qcom,cpr-aging-derate:	Array of scaling factors which define the amount of derating to apply to the reference
				aging voltage margin adjustment for each of the fuse corners. Each element has units
				of uV/mV. This property must be of length defined by qcom,cpr-fuse-corners.

				[0]: => the fuse row number of the bits
				[1]: => LSB bit position of the bits
				[2]: => number of the bits
				[3]: => fuse reading method, 0 for direct reading or 1 for SCM reading
				The number of quadruples should be equal to the number of values specified in
				the qcom,cpr-aging-sensor-id property. This property is required if
				the qcom,cpr-aging-sensor-id property has been specified.
