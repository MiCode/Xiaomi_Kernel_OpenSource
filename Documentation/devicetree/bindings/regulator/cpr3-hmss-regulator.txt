Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. CPR3 Regulator - HMSS Specific Bindings

HMSS CPR3 controllers each support two CPR threads that monitor the voltage of
a pair of application processor (HMSS) clusters that are powered by a shared
regulator supply.  These controllers have a hardware aggregator to combine the
UP/DOWN requests from each CPR thread into a single unified request.  They also
have a hardware channel to use these requests to directly change the supply
voltage at the PMIC via the SPM without software intervention.

HMSS CPR3 controllers also have to take into account the state of the memory
array power mux (APM) when scaling voltage to ensure that memory always receives
a sufficiently high voltage.

Both CPR open-loop voltages and CPR target quotients are stored in hardware
fuses for HMSS CPR3 controllers.

This document describes the HMSS specific CPR3 bindings.

=======================
Required Node Structure
=======================

CPR3 regulators must be described in three levels of devices nodes.  The first
level describes the CPR3 controller.  The second level describes one or more
hardware threads managed by the controller.  The third level describes one or
more logical regulators handled by each CPR thread.

All platform independent cpr3-regulator binding guidelines defined in
cpr3-regulator.txt also apply to cpr3-hmss-regulator devices.
