Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. CPR3 Regulator - MMSS Specific Bindings

MMSS CPR3 controllers each support one CPR thread that monitors the voltage of
the graphics processor (MMSS) supply regulator.  The CPR open-loop voltages are
stored in hardware fuses for MMSS CPR3 controllers.  However, the CPR target
quotients must be defined in device tree.

This document describes the MMSS specific CPR3 bindings.

=======================
Required Node Structure
=======================

CPR3 regulators must be described in three levels of devices nodes.  The first
level describes the CPR3 controller.  The second level describes exacly one
hardware thread managed by the controller.  The third level describes one or
more logical regulators handled by the CPR thread.

All platform independent cpr3-regulator binding guidelines defined in
cpr3-regulator.txt also apply to cpr3-hmss-regulator devices.

====================================
First Level Nodes - CPR3 Controllers
====================================

MMSS specific properties:
- compatible
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,cpr3-msm8996-mmss-regulator"

- clocks
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Array of clock tuples in which each tuple consists of a
		    phandle to a clock device and a clock ID number.  The
		    following clocks must be specified: MMSS RBCPR, MMSS RBCPR
		    AHB, and MMSS MMAGIC AHB.

- clock-names
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Clock names.  This list must match up 1-to-1 with the clocks
		    specified in the 'clocks' property. "core_clk", "iface_clk",
		    and "bus_clk" must be specified.

MMSS specific properties:
N/A

===============================================
Third Level Nodes - CPR Regulators for a Thread
===============================================

MMSS specific properties:
- qcom,cpr-fuse-corners
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Specifies the number of fuse corners.  This value must be 4
		    for MMSS.

- qcom,cpr-fuse-combos
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Specifies the number of fuse combinations being supported by
		    the device.  This value is utilized by several other
		    properties.  Supported values are 1 up to the maximum
		    possible for a given regulator type.  For MMSS the maximum
		    supported value is 8.  These combos correspond to CPR
		    revision fuse values from 0 to 7 in order.

- qcom,cpr-speed-bins
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Specifies the number of speed bins being supported by the
		    device.  This value is utilized by several other properties.
		    Supported values are 1 up to the maximum possible for a
		    given regulator type.  For MMSS the maximum supported value
		    is 1.

- qcom,mem-acc-voltage
	Usage:      required if mem-acc-supply is specified for the CPR3 controller
		    containing this CPR3 regulator
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of integer tuples which each define the mem-acc-supply
		    corner for each voltage corner in order from lowest to highest.

		    The list must contain qcom,cpr-fuse-combos number of tuples
		    in which case the tuples are matched to fuse combinations
		    1-to-1 or qcom,cpr-speed-bins number of tuples in which case
		    the tuples are matched to speed bins 1-to-1 or exactly 1
		    tuple which is used regardless of the fuse combination and
		    speed bin found on a given chip.

		    Each tuple must be of the length defined in the
		    corresponding element of the qcom,cpr-corners property or
		    the qcom,cpr-speed-bins property.  A single tuple may only
		    be specified if all of the corner counts in qcom,cpr-corners
		    are the same.

- qcom,cpr-target-quotients
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A grouping of integer tuple lists.  Each tuple defines the
		    CPR target quotient for each ring oscillator (RO) for a
		    given corner.  Since CPR3 supports exactly 16 ROs, each
		    tuple must contain 16 elements corresponding to RO0 through
		    RO15 in order.  If a given RO is unused for a corner, then
		    its target quotient should be specified as 0.

		    Each tuple list in the grouping must meet the same size
		    requirements as those specified for qcom,mem-acc-voltage
		    above. The tuples in a given list are ordered from the
		    lowest corner to the highest corner.

- qcom,cpr-ro-scaling-factor
	Usage:      required if qcom,cpr-closed-loop-voltage-adjustment is
		    specified
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: The common definition of this property in cpr3-regulator.txt
		    is accurate for MMSS CPR3 controllers except for this
		    modification:

		    Each tuple list must contain the number of tuples defined in
		    the corresponding element of the qcom,cpr-corners property
		    or the qcom,cpr-speed-bins property as opposed to the value
		    of the qcom,cpr-fuse-corners property.

- qcom,cpr-fused-closed-loop-voltage-adjustment-map
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of integer tuples which each define the CPR fused
		    corner closed-loop offset adjustment fuse to utilize for
		    each voltage corner in order from lowest to highest.

		    The list must contain qcom,cpr-fuse-combos number of tuples
		    in which case the tuples are matched to fuse combinations
		    1-to-1 or qcom,cpr-speed-bins number of tuples in which case
		    the tuples are matched to speed bins 1-to-1 or exactly 1
		    tuple which is used regardless of the fuse combination and
		    speed bin found on a given chip.

		    Each tuple must be of the length defined in the
		    corresponding element of the qcom,cpr-corners property or
		    the qcom,cpr-speed-bins property.  A single tuple may only
		    be specified if all of the corner counts in qcom,cpr-corners
		    are the same.

		    Each tuple element must be either 0 or in the range 1 to
		    qcom,cpr-fuse-corners.  A value of 0 signifies that no fuse
		    based adjustment should be applied to the fuse corner.
		    Values 1 to qcom,cpr-fuse-corners denote the specific fuse
		    corner that should be used by a given voltage corner.

Note that the qcom,cpr-closed-loop-voltage-fuse-adjustment property is not
meaningful for MMSS CPR3 regulator nodes since target quotients are not defined
in fuses.
