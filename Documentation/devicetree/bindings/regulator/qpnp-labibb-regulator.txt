QTI's LAB (LCD/AMOLED BOOST)/IBB (Inverting Buck-Boost) Regulator

LAB can be used as a standalone positive boost power supply for general purpose
applications. IBB can be used as a standalone negative power supply for general
applications. Also, LAB and IBB can be used together to provide power supply for
display panels, LCD or AMOLED.

Main node required properties:

- compatible:			Must be "qcom,qpnp-labibb-regulator"
- qcom,qpnp-labibb-mode:	A string used to specify the working mode of LAB/IBB
				regulators when bootloader does not turned on the
				display panel. Could be "lcd" or "amoled".
				"lcd" means using LAB and IBB regulators are
				configured for LCD mode.
				"amoled" means using LAB and IBB regulators are
				configured for AMOLED mode.
- qcom,pmic-revid:		Specifies the phandle of the PMIC revid module.
				Used to identify the PMIC subtype.

Main node optional properties:

- qcom,qpnp-labibb-touch-to-wake-en:	A boolean property which upon set will
					enable support for touch-to-wake mode
					by configuring the required settings
					in LAB and IBB modules. Make sure the
					hardware has needed support before
					enabling this property.
- qcom,swire-control:			A boolean property which indicates if the LAB/IBB is
					controlled by the SWIRE interface. Enable only
					if qcom,qpnp-labibb-mode = "amoled".
- qcom,labibb-ttw-force-lab-on:		A boolean property which forces LAB to be
					always on during TTW mode.
- qcom,skip-2nd-swire-cmd:		A boolean property which indicates if
					the second SWIRE command needs to be skipped.
- qcom,swire-2nd-cmd-delay:		An integer value which specifes the
					delay in millisecs between the first and second
					SWIRE command. If not specified this value
					defaults to 20ms. This delay is applied only
					if 'qcom,skip-2nd-swire-cmd' is defined.
- qcom,swire-ibb-ps-enable-delay:	An integer value which specifes the delay
					in millisecs to enable IBB pulse-skipping
					after the skip-2nd-swire-cmd workaround is applied.

					This property is applicable only if
					'qcom,skip-2nd-swire-cmd' is specified.
- qcom,labibb-standalone:		A boolean property which forces LAB and
					IBB to operate in standalone mode. If
					this is not specified, then LAB and IBB

					and IBB regulators. This will be mostly
					needed when LAB and IBB are operating
					in standalone mode to vote for MBG.

Following properties are available only for PM660A:

- qcom,pbs-control:			A boolean property which indicates if
					the LAB/IBB is controlled by the PBS
					sequencer. If this mode is enabled the
					PBS sequencer does the SWIRE remapping
					and program the voltages based on the
					SWIRE count.
