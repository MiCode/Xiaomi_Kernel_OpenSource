QTI's LAB (LCD/AMOLED BOOST)/IBB (Inverting Buck-Boost) Regulator

LAB can be used as a standalone positive boost power supply for general purpose
applications. IBB can be used as a standalone negative power supply for general
applications. Also, LAB and IBB can be used together to provide power supply for
display panels, LCD or AMOLED.

Main node required properties:

				regulators when bootloader does not turned on the
				display panel. Could be "lcd", "amoled" or
				"stand-alone".
				"lcd" means using LAB and IBB regulators are
				configured for LCD mode together.
				"amoled" means using LAB and IBB regulators are
				configured for AMOLED mode together.
