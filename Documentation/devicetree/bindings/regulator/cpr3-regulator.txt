Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. CPR3 Regulator - Platform Independent Bindings

Core Power Reduction (CPR) version 3 controllers are used by some Qualcomm
Technologies, Inc. (QTI) SoCs to manage important voltage regulators.  CPR3
controllers are capable of monitoring several ring oscillator sensing loops
simultaneously.  The CPR3 controller informs software when the silicon
conditions require the supply voltage to be increased or decreased.  On certain
supply rails, the CPR3 controller is able to propagate the voltage increase
or decrease requests all the way to the PMIC without software involvement.

This document describes the common platform independent bindings that apply
to all CPR3 controllers.

=======================
Required Node Structure
=======================

CPR3 regulators must be described in three levels of devices nodes.  The first
level describes the CPR3 controller.  The second level describes one or more
hardware threads managed by the controller.  The third level describes one or
more logical regulators handled by each CPR thread.

		    corners and after adjustments have been applied.

		    The list and tuples must meet the same size requirements as
		    those specified for qcom,cpr-voltage-ceiling above.

		    difference is assumed to be 0 uV for all corners.

- qcom,cpr-closed-loop-voltage-fuse-adjustment
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of integer tuples which each define the closed-loop

	Definition: A grouping of integer tuple lists.  Each tuple defines the
		    CPR ring oscillator (RO) scaling factor with units of QUOT/V
		    for each RO for a given fuse corner.  Since CPR3 supports
		    exactly 16 ROs, each tuple must contain 16 elements
		    corresponding to RO0 through RO15 in order.  If a given RO
		    is unused for a fuse corner, then its scaling factor may be
		    specified as 0.

		    Each tuple list must contain the number of tuples defined in
		    the qcom,cpr-fuse-corners property.  The tuples in a given
		    list are ordered from the lowest fuse corner to the highest
		    fuse corner.

		    The tuple list grouping must contain qcom,cpr-fuse-combos
		    number of tuple lists in which case the lists are matched to
		    fuse combinations 1-to-1 or qcom,cpr-speed-bins number of
		    tuple lists in which case the lists are matched to
		    speed bins 1-to-1 or exactly 1 list which is used regardless
		    of the fuse combination and speed bin found on a given chip.

		    The target quotient adjustment to apply for each RO of a
		    given corner is determined by multiplying the adjustment
		    value in qcom,cpr-closed-loop-voltage-fuse-adjustment or
		    qcom,cpr-closed-loop-voltage-adjustment by the relevant RO
		    scaling factor in this property.

		    elements in which case the elements are matched to fuse
		    combinations 1-to-1 or qcom,cpr-speed-bins number of
		    elements in which case the elements are matched to
		    speed bins 1-to-1 or exactly 1 element which is used
		    regardless of the fuse combination and speed bin found
		    on a given chip.

- qcom,allow-aging-open-loop-voltage-adjustment
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of integers which specifies if CPR aging adjustment
		    should be applied to open-loop voltages for each fuse
		    combination.  Note that aging adjustment must be allowed via
		    qcom,allow-aging-voltage-adjustment in order for this
		    property to have an effect.
		    Supported per-combo element values:
			0 - do not perform CPR aging adjustment
			1 - perform CPR aging adjustment

		    specified for qcom,allow-aging-voltage-adjustment above.

	Usage:      required if qcom,allow-aging-voltage-adjustment is specified
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of integers which defines the maximum CPR aging
		    voltage margin adjustment in microvolts that may be added
		    for each fuse combination.  If this property is specified
		    and the adjustment specified is greater than 0, then aging
		    adjustments are required for this regulator.

		    specified for qcom,allow-aging-voltage-adjustment above.

	Usage:      required if qcom,allow-aging-voltage-adjustment is specified
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of integers which defines the CPR aging ring
		    oscillator (RO) scaling factor with units of QUOT/V to use
		    during aging measurements for each fuse combination.

		    specified for qcom,allow-aging-voltage-adjustment above.

- qcom,cpr-aging-derate
	Usage:      optional, though only meaningful if
		    qcom,allow-aging-voltage-adjustment is specified
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of integer tuples which each define the CPR aging
		    derating scaling factor to apply to the closed-loop voltage
		    margin adjustment for each corner.  The individual scaling
		    factors have units of uV/mV and are ordered from lowest to
		    highest corner per tuple.  For example, a value of 900
		    specifies that the voltage adjustment for the corner should
		    be 90% (900/1000) of that for the reference corner.

		    The list and tuples must meet the same size requirements as
		    those specified for qcom,cpr-voltage-ceiling above.

		    If this property is not specified, then it is assumed that
		    no corners require derating (i.e. the scaling factor would
		    be 1000).

All properties specified within the core regulator framework can also be used in
third level nodes.  These bindings can be found in:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.
