Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. CPR3 Regulator - Platform Independent Bindings

Core Power Reduction (CPR) version 3 controllers are used by some Qualcomm
Technologies, Inc. (QTI) SoCs to manage important voltage regulators.  CPR3
controllers are capable of monitoring several ring oscillator sensing loops
simultaneously.  The CPR3 controller informs software when the silicon
conditions require the supply voltage to be increased or decreased.  On certain
supply rails, the CPR3 controller is able to propagate the voltage increase
or decrease requests all the way to the PMIC without software involvement.

This document describes the common platform independent bindings that apply
to all CPR3 controllers.

=======================
Required Node Structure
=======================

CPR3 regulators must be described in two levels of devices nodes.  The first
level describes the CPR3 controller.  The second level describes one or more
hardware threads managed by the controller.

		    binding files for further requirements.

- qcom,cpr-fuse-combos
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Specifies the number of fuse combinations being supported by
		    the device.  This value is utilized by several other
		    properties.  Supported values are 1 up to the maximum
		    possible for a given regulator type.  See platform specific
		    binding files for further details.

- qcom,cpr-corners
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of integers which defines how many voltage corners
		    are to be used for each fuse combination.  The list must
		    contain either qcom,cpr-fuse-combos number of elements in
		    which case the corner counts are applied to fuse
		    combinations 1-to-1 or the list must contain exactly 1
		    element which is used regardless of the fuse combination
		    found on a given chip.

- qcom,cpr-corner-fmax-map
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of integer tuples which each define the highest
		    (i.e. maximum frequency) 1-based corner value associated
		    with each fuse-corner.  Each tuple must have a number of
		    elements equal to the value of the qcom,cpr-fuse-corners
		    property.  The elements of a tuple are ordered from lowest
		    to highest fuse corner.  The list must contain either
		    qcom,cpr-fuse-combos number of tuples in which case the
		    tuple mappings are applied to fuse combinations 1-to-1 or
		    the list must contain exactly 1 tuple which is used
		    regardless of the fuse combination found on a given chip.

- qcom,cpr-voltage-ceiling
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of integer tuples which each define the CPR ceiling
		    voltage in microvolts for each voltage corner in order from
		    lowest to highest.

		    The list must contain either qcom,cpr-fuse-combos number of
		    tuples in which case the tuples are matched to fuse
		    combinations 1-to-1 or the list must contain exactly 1 tuple
		    which is used regardless of the fuse combination found on a
		    given chip.

		    Each tuple must be of the length defined in the
		    corresponding element of the qcom,cpr-corners property.  A
		    single tuple may only be specified if all of the corner
		    counts in qcom,cpr-corners are the same.

	Usage:      required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of integer tuples which each define the CPR floor
		    voltage in microvolts for each voltage corner in order from
		    lowest to highest.

	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <empty>
	Definition: Boolean flag which indicates that it is acceptable to use
		    interpolated open-loop voltage values.  These values are
		    interpolated between the open-loop voltage Fmax fuse values.

All properties specified within the core regulator framework can also be used in
second level nodes.  These bindings can be found in:
