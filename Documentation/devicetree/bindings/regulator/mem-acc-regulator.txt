Qualcomm Technologies Memory Accelerator

Memory accelerator configures the power-mode (corner) for the
accelerator.

Required properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,mem-acc-regulator"
- regulator-name:		A string used to describe the regulator
- regulator-min-microvolt:	Minimum corner value as min constraint, which
				should be 1 for SVS corner
- regulator-max-microvolt:	Maximum corner value as max constraint, which
				should be 4 for SUPER_TURBO or 3 for TURBO
- qcom,corner-acc-map		Array which maps the APC (application processor)
				corner value to the accelerator corner.
				[0] maps APC SVS corner (1) to accelerator SVS corner
				[1] maps APC NOMINAL corner (2) to accelerator NOMINAL corner
				[2] maps APC TURBO corner (3) to accelerator TURBO corner

Optional properties:
- reg:				Register addresses for acc-sel-l1, acc-sel-l2 control, acc-en,
				MEM ACC eFuse address, acc-l1-custom , acc-l2-custom,
				mem-acc-type1, mem-acc-type2, mem-acc-type3, mem-acc-type4,
				mem-acc-type5 and mem-acc-type6.
- reg-names:			Register names. Must be "acc-sel-l1",
				"acc-sel-l2", "acc-en", "efuse_addr",
				"acc-l1-custom", "acc-l2-custom", "mem-acc-type1",
				"mem-acc-type2", "mem-acc-type3", "mem-acc-type4",
				"mem-acc-type5", "mem-acc-type6".
				A given mem-acc-regulator driver must have "acc-sel-l1" or
				"acc-sel-l2" or "mem-acc-type*" reg-names property and
				related register address property.
- qcom,acc-en-bit-pos		Array which specifies bit positions in the
				'acc-en' register. Setting these bits forces the
				the acclerator to use the corner value specified
				in the 'acc-sel-l1' and 'acc-sel-l2' register.
- qcom,acc-sel-l1-bit-size	Integer which specifies the number of bits in
				the 'acc-sel-l1' register which define each L1
				select parameter.  If this property is not
				specified, then a default value of 2 is assumed.
- qcom,acc-sel-l1-bit-pos	Array which specifies bit positions in the
				'acc-sel-l1' register. Each element in this array
				is the LSB of an N-bit value where 'N' is
				defined by the qcom,acc-sel-l1-bit-size
				property.  This N-bit value specifies the corner
				value used by the accelerator for the L1 cache.
- qcom,acc-sel-l2-bit-size	Integer which specifies the number of bits in
				the 'acc-sel-l2' register which define each L2
				select parameter.  If this property is not
				specified, then a default value of 2 is assumed.
- qcom,acc-sel-l2-bit-pos	Array which specifies bit positions in the
				'acc-sel-l2' register. Each element in this array
				is the LSB of an N-bit value where 'N' is
				defined by the qcom,acc-sel-l2-bit-size
				property.  This N-bit value specifies the corner
				value used by the accelerator for the L2 cache.
- qcom,l1-acc-custom-data:	Array which maps APC corner values to L1 ACC custom data values.
				The corresponding custom data is written into the custom register
				while switching between APC corners. The custom register address
				is specified by "acc-11-custom" reg-property. The length of the array
				should be equal to number of APC corners.
- qcom,l2-acc-custom-data:	Array which maps APC corner values to L2 ACC custom data values.
				The corresponding custom data is written into the custom register
				while switching between APC corners. The custom register address
				is specified by "acc-l2-custom" reg-property. The length of the array
				should be equal to number of APC corners.
- qcom,override-acc-fuse-sel:	Array of 4 elements which specify the way to read the override fuse.
				The override fuse value is used by the qcom,override-fuse-version-map
				to identify the correct set of override properties.
				The 4 elements with index [0..4] are:
				  [0] => the fuse row number of the selector
				  [1] => LSB bit position of the bits
				  [2] => number of bits
				  [3] => fuse reading method, 0 for direct reading or 1 for SCM reading
- qcom,override-fuse-version-map: Array of integers which each match to a override fuse value.
				Any element in a tuple may use the value 0xffffffff as a wildcard.
				The index of the first value (in the array) which matches the override fuse
				is used to select the right tuples from the other override properties.
- qcom,override-corner-acc-map:	Array of tuples which overrides the existing acc-corner map
				(specified by qcom,corner-acc-map) with corner values selected
				from this property. "qcom,override-corner-acc-map" must contain the
				same number of tuples as "qcom,override-fuse-version-map". These tuples
				are then mapped one-to-one in the order specified. If the
				"qcom,override-fuse-version-map" property is not specified, then
				"qcom,override-corner-acc-map" must contain a single tuple which is then
				applied unconditionally.
- qcom,override-l1-acc-custom-data:	Array of tuples of which overrides the existing l1-acc-custom data
				(specified by qcom,l1-acc-custom-data), with values specified in this property.
				The corresponding custom data is written into the custom register while
				switching between APC corners. The custom register address is specified by
				"acc-11-custom" reg-property. This property can only be specified if the
				"qcom,l1-acc-custom-data" is already defined. If the
				"qcom,override-fuse-version-map" property is specified, then
				qcom,override-l1-acc-custom-data must contain the same number of tuples
				as "qcom,override-fuse-version-map". These tuples are then mapped one-to-one
				in the order specified. If the qcom,override-fuse-version-map property is
				not specified, then "qcom,override-l1-acc-custom-data" must contain a single
				tuple which is then applied unconditionally.
- qcom,override-l2-acc-custom-data:	Array of tuples of which overrides the existing l1-acc-custom data
				(specified by qcom,l2-acc-custom-data), with values specified in this property.
				The corresponding custom data is written into the custom register while
				switching between APC corners. The custom register address is specified by
				"acc-12-custom" reg-property. This property can only be specified if the
				"qcom,l2-acc-custom-data" is already defined. If the
				"qcom,override-fuse-version-map" property is specified, then
				"qcom,override-l2-acc-custom-data" must contain the same number of tuples
				as "qcom,override-fuse-version-map". These tuples are then mapped one-to-one
				in the order specified. If the qcom,override-fuse-version-map property is
				not specified, then "qcom,override-l2-acc-custom-data" must contain a single
				tuple which is then applied unconditionally.
- qcom,mem-acc-type1:		Array which specifies the value to be written to the mem acc type1 register for each fuse
				corner, from the lowest fuse corner to the highest fuse corner. The length of the array
				must be equal to the number of APC fuse corners. This property must be present if reg names
				specifies mem-acc-type1.
- qcom,mem-acc-type2:		Same as qcom,mem-acc-type1 except for mem acc type2 register.
- qcom,mem-acc-type3:		Same as qcom,mem-acc-type1 except for mem acc type3 register.
- qcom,mem-acc-type4:		Same as qcom,mem-acc-type1 except for mem acc type4 register.
- qcom,mem-acc-type5:		Same as qcom,mem-acc-type1 except for mem acc type5 register.
- qcom,mem-acc-type6:		Same as qcom,mem-acc-type1 except for mem acc type6 register.
