Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. CPR4 Regulator - APSS Specific Bindings

APSS CPR4 controllers each support one CPR thread that monitors the voltage of
a pair of application processor (APSS) clusters that are powered by a shared
regulator supply. They also have a hardware channel to use these requests to
directly change the supply voltage at the PMIC via the SPM without software
intervention.

APSS CPR4 controllers also have to take into account the state of the memory
array power mux (APM) when scaling voltage to ensure that memory always receives
a sufficiently high voltage.

Both CPR open-loop voltages and CPR target quotients are stored in hardware
fuses for APSS CPR4 controllers.

This document describes the APSS specific CPR4 bindings.

=======================
Required Node Structure
=======================

CPR4 regulators must be described in three levels of devices nodes.  The first
level describes the CPR4 controller.  The second level describes one or more
hardware threads managed by the controller.  The third level describes one or
more logical regulators handled by each CPR thread.

All platform independent cpr3-regulator binding guidelines defined in
cpr3-regulator.txt also apply to cpr4-apss-regulator devices.
