- qcom, msm_bus,name: Should be "qseecom-noc"
- qcom, msm_bus,num_cases: Depends on the use cases for bus scaling
- qcom, msm_bus,num_paths: The paths for source and destination ports
- qcom, msm_bus,vectors: Vectors for bus topology.
- qcom,ce-opp-freq: indicates the CE operating frequency in Hz, changes from target to target.

  - vdd-hba-supply   : handle for fixed power regulator
  - qcom,qsee-reentrancy-support: indicates the qsee reentrancy phase supported by the target

Example:
	qcom,qseecom@fe806000 {
		compatible = "qcom,qseecom";
		reg = <0x7f00000 0x500000>;
		reg-names = "secapp-region";
                qcom,disk-encrypt-pipe-pair = <2>;
                qcom,file-encrypt-pipe-pair = <0>;
		qcom,support-multiple-ce-hw-instance;
		qcom,hlos-num-ce-hw-instances = <2>;
		qcom,hlos-ce-hw-instance = <1 2>;
		qcom,qsee-ce-hw-instance = <0>;
		qcom,support-fde;
		qcom,support-pfe;
		qcom,msm_bus,name = "qseecom-noc";
		qcom,msm_bus,num_cases = <4>;
		qcom,msm_bus,active_only = <0>;
		qcom,msm_bus,num_paths = <1>;
		qcom,no-clock-support;
		qcom,appsbl-qseecom-support;
		qcom,msm_bus,vectors =
			<55 512 0 0>,
			<55 512 3936000000 393600000>,
			<55 512 3936000000 393600000>,
			<55 512 3936000000 393600000>;
		qcom,ce-opp-freq = <100000000>;
		vdd-hba-supply = <&gdsc_ufs>;
	};

Example: The following dts setup is the same as the example above.

	qcom,qseecom@fe806000 {
		compatible = "qcom,qseecom";
		reg = <0x7f00000 0x500000>;
		reg-names = "secapp-region";
		qcom,support-fde;
		qcom,full-disk-encrypt-info = <0 1 2>, <0 2 2>;
		qcom,support-pfe;
		qcom,per-file-encrypt-info = <0 1 0>, <0 2 0>;
		qcom,qsee-ce-hw-instance = <0>;
		qcom,msm_bus,name = "qseecom-noc";
		qcom,msm_bus,num_cases = <4>;
		qcom,msm_bus,active_only = <0>;

		qcom,no-clock-support;
		qcom,appsbl-qseecom-support;
		qcom,msm_bus,vectors =
			<55 512 0 0>,
			<55 512 3936000000 393600000>,
			<55 512 3936000000 393600000>,
