MSM HSIC XHCI controller

Required properties :
- compatible : should be "qcom,xhci-msm-hsic"
- reg : offset and length of the register set in the memory map
- interrupts: IRQ lines used by this controller.
- interrupt-names : Required interrupt resource entries are:
	"core_irq" : Interrupt for HSIC core
	"pwr_event_irq" : Interrupt generated by HSIC controller due to
	change in power state.
- <supply-name>-supply: handle to the regulator device tree node
  Required "supply-name" are "hsic-vdd-dig" and "hsic-gdsc-supply".
- hsic,<gpio-name>-gpio : handle to the GPIO node, see "gpios property"
  in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.
  Required "gpio-name" are "strobe" and "data".
- qcom,vdd-voltage-level: This property must be a list of three integer
  values (no, min, max) where each value represents either a voltage in
  microvolts or a value corresponding to voltage corner.

Example MSM HSIC XHCI controller device node :
	xhci_hsic_host: qcom,xhci-msm-hsic@0xf9c00000 {
		compatible = "qcom,xhci-msm-hsic";
		reg = <0xf9c00000 0xfc000>;
		interrupts = <0 32 0>,
			   <0 29 0>;
		interrupt-names = "core_irq", "pwr_event_irq";
		hsic-vdd-dig-supply = <&pma8084_s2_corner>;
		hsic-gdsc-supply = <&gdsc_usb_hsic>;
		hsic,strobe-gpio = <&msmgpio 134 0x00>;
		hsic,data-gpio = <&msmgpio 135 0x00>;
		qcom,vdd-voltage-level = <1 5 7>;
	};
