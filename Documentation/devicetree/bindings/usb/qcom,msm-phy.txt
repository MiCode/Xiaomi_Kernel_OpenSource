   USB3_DP_DP_PHY_PD_CTL,
   USB3_DP_COM_POWER_DOWN_CTRL,
   USB3_DP_COM_SW_RESET,

   Optional register for enabling/disabling VLS clamp if available:
   USB3_PCS_MISC_CLAMP_ENABLE

   Optional register for configuring USB Type-C port select if available:
   USB3_PHY_PCS_MISC_TYPEC_CTRL

- resets: reset specifier pair consists of phandle for the reset controller
  and reset lines used by this controller.
- reset-names: reset signal name strings sorted in the same order as the resets
  property.

Optional properties:
 - reg: Additional register set of address and length to control QMP PHY are:
   "tcsr_usb3_dp_phymode" : top-level CSR register to be written to select
   super speed usb qmp phy.
   "pcs_clamp_enable_reg" : Clamps the phy data inputs and enables USB3
   autonomous mode.
   "vls_clamp_reg" : top-level CSR register to be written to enable phy vls
   clamp which allows phy to detect autonomous mode.
 - clocks: a list of phandles to the PHY clocks. Use as per
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
 - clock-names: Names of the clocks in 1-1 correspondence with the "clocks"
   property. "cfg_ahb_clk" and "com_aux_clk" are an optional clocks.
 - qcom,vbus-valid-override: If present, indicates VBUS pin is not connected to
   the USB PHY and the controller must rely on external VBUS notification in
   order to manually relay the notification to the SSPHY.
