MSM HSIC EHCI controller

Required properties :
- compatible : should be "qcom,hsic-host"
- regs : offset and length of the register set in the memory map
- interrupts: IRQ lines used by this controller
- interrupt-names : Required interrupt resource entries are:
	"core_irq" : Interrupt for HSIC core
- <supply-name>-supply: handle to the regulator device tree node
  Required "supply-name" is either "hsic_vdd_dig" or "HSIC_VDDCX" and
  optionally - "HSIC_GDSC".

Optional properties :
- interrupt-parent - This must provide reference to the current
        device node.
- #address-cells - Should provide a value of 0.
- interrupts - Should be <0 1 2> and it is an index to the
        interrupt-map.
- #interrupt-cells - should provide a value of 1.
- #interrupt-mask - should provide a value of 0xffffffff.
- interrupt-map - Must create mapping for the number of interrupts
        that are defined in above interrupts property.
        For HSIC device node, it should define 3 mappings for
        core_irq, async_irq and wakeup in the format
        mentioned in below example node of HSIC.

- interrupt-names : Optional interrupt resource entries are:
	"async_irq" : Interrupt from HSIC for asynchronous events in HSIC LPM.
	"wakeup" : Wakeup interrupt from HSIC during suspend (or XO shutdown).
- hsic,<gpio-name>-gpio : handle to the GPIO node, see "gpios property"
  in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.
  Optional "gpio-name" can be "strobe", "data" and "resume".
- hsic,resume-gpio : if present then periperal connected to hsic controller
  cannot wakeup from XO shutdown using in-band hsic resume. Use resume
  gpio to wakeup peripheral
- hsic,ignore-cal-pad-config : If present then HSIC CAL PAD configuration
  using TLMM is not performed.
- hsic,strobe-pad-offset : Offset of TLMM register for configuring HSIC
  STROBE GPIO PAD.
- hsic,data-pad-offset : Offset of TLMM register for configuring HSIC
  DATA GPIO PAD.
- qcom,phy-sof-workaround : If present then HSIC PHY has h/w BUGs related to
  SOFs. All the relevant software workarounds are required for the same during
  suspend, reset and resume.
- qcom,phy-susp-sof-workaround : If present then HSIC PHY has h/w BUG related to
  SOFs while entering SUSPEND. Relevant software workaround is required for the same
  during SUSPEND only.
- qcom,pool-64-bit-align: If present then the pool's memory will be aligned
  to 64 bits
- qcom,enable_hbm: if present host bus manager is enabled.
- qcom,disable-park-mode: if present park mode is enabled. Park mode enables executing
  up to 3 usb packets from each QH.
- hsic,consider-ipa-handshake: If present then hsic low power mode is
  depend on suitable handshake with the IPA peer.
- qcom,ahb-async-bridge-bypass: if present AHB ASYNC bridge will be bypassed such that
  the bridge on the slave AHB is always used.
- hsic,log2-itc: itc (interrupt threshold control) defines rate at which usb
  controller will issue interrupts. It represents max interrupt interval
  measured in micro frames.  In high speed USB, each micro frame is 125us.
  Valid values are from zero to six. Zero is default. Higher ITC value will
  result in higher interrupt latency and can impact overall data latency.

  log2-itc     - Max interrupt threshold
  --------       -----------------------
  0 (2^0 = 1)    1 micro frame interrupt threshold aka 125us interrupt threshold
  1 (2^1 = 2)    2 micro frame interrupt threshold aka 250us interrupt threshold
  2 (2^2 = 4)    4 micro frame interrupt threshold aka 500us interrupt threshold
  3 (2^3 = 8)    8 micro frame interrupt threshold aka 1ms interrupt threshold
  4 (2^4 = 16)   16 micro frame interrupt threshold aka 2ms interrupt threshold
  5 (2^5 = 32)   32 micro frame interrupt threshold aka 4ms interrupt threshold
  6 (2^6 = 64)   64 micro frame interrupt threshold aka 8ms interrupt threshold

- hsic,disable-cerr: CERR is 2bit down error counter that keeps track of number
  of consecutive errors detected on single usb transaction. When set to non
  zero value, hw decrements the count and updates qTD when transaction fails.
  If counter reaches zero, hw marks the qTD inactive and triggers the interrupt.
  When CERR is programmed to zero, hw ignores transaction failures. ECHI stack
  programs the CERR  to 3 by default. When this flag is true, CERR is set to
  zero and transaction errors are ignored.

- hsic,reset-delay: If present then add the given delay time (ms) between
  the reset and enumeration. Since some devices might take more than 100ms
  for initialization when receiving the bus reset, add delay to avoid the
  problem that enmueration is before device initialization done.
- hsic,vdd-voltage-level: This property must be a list of three integer
  values (no, min, max) where each value represents either a voltage in
  microvolts or a value corresponding to voltage corner

    - qcom,msm_bus,num_cases
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_paths
    - qcom,msm_bus,vectors
