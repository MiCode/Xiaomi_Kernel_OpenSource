MSM SuperSpeed USB3.0 SoC controller

Required properties :
- compatible : should be "qcom,dwc-usb3-msm"
 - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
   Required regs are:
	"core_base" : usb controller register set
- interrupts: IRQ lines used by this controller
- interrupt-names : Interrupt resource entries are :
	"hs_phy_irq" : Interrupt from HS PHY for asynchronous events in LPM.
	"pwr_event_irq" : Interrupt to controller for asynchronous events in LPM.
	Used for SS-USB power events.

Optional properties :
- reg: Additional registers
     "tcsr_base" : top-level CSR register to be written during power-on reset
     initialize the internal MUX that controls whether to use USB3 controller
     with primary port.
     "ahb2phy_base" : top-level register to configure read/write wait cycle with
     both QMP and QUSB PHY registers.
- Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
  below optional properties:
    - qcom,msm_bus,name
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_cases
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_paths
    - qcom,msm_bus,vectors
- interrupt-names : Optional interrupt resource entries are:
    "pmic_id_irq" : Interrupt from PMIC for external ID pin notification.
    "ss_phy_irq"  : Interrupt from super speed phy for wake up notification.
- qcom,charging-disabled: If present then battery charging using USB
  is disabled.
- vbus_dwc3-supply: phandle to the 5V VBUS supply regulator used for host mode.
- USB3_GDSC-supply : phandle to the globally distributed switch controller
  regulator node to the USB controller.
- qcom,dwc-usb3-msm-tx-fifo-size: If present, represents RAM size available for
		TX fifo allocation in bytes
- qcom,usb-dbm : phandle for the DBM device
- qcom,lpm-to-suspend-delay-ms: Indicates timeout (in milliseconds) to release wakeup source
  after USB is kept into LPM.
- qcom,vbus-present: Indicates that there is no VBUS indication from PMIC. Assume VBUS is
  present if this property is defined.
- qcom,ext-hub-reset-gpio: This corresponds to gpio which is used for HUB reset.
- qcom,disable-dev-mode-pm: If present, it disables PM runtime functionality for device mode.
- qcom,disable-host-mode-pm: If present, it disables XHCI PM runtime functionality when USB
  host mode is used.
Sub nodes:
- Sub node for "DWC3- USB3 controller".
  This sub node is required property for device node. The properties of this subnode
  are specified in dwc3.txt.
