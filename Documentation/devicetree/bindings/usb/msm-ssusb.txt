MSM SuperSpeed USB3.0 SoC controller

Required properties :
- compatible : should be "qcom,dwc-usb3-msm"
- reg : offset and length of the register set in the memory map
	offset and length of the TCSR register for routing USB
	signals to either picoPHY0 or picoPHY1.
- interrupts: IRQ lines used by this controller
- <supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
  Required "supply-name" examples are:
	"vbus_dwc3" : vbus supply for host mode
- qcom,dwc-usb3-msm-dbm-eps: Number of endpoints avaliable for
  the DBM (Device Bus Manager). The DBM is HW unit which is part of
  the MSM USB3.0 core (which also includes the Synopsys DesignWare
  USB3.0 controller)

Optional properties :
- Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
  below optional properties:
    - qcom,msm_bus,name
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_cases
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_paths
    - qcom,msm_bus,vectors
- interrupt-names : Optional interrupt resource entries are:
    "hs_phy_irq" : Interrupt from HSPHY for asynchronous events in LPM.
	This is not used if wakeup events are received externally (e.g. PMIC)
    "pmic_id_irq" : Interrupt from PMIC for external ID pin notification.
- qcom,otg-capability: If present then depend on PMIC for VBUS notifications,
  otherwise depend on PHY.
- qcom,charging-disabled: If present then battery charging using USB
  is disabled.
- qcom,skip-charger-detection: If present then charger detection using BC1.2
  is not supported and attached host should always be assumed as SDP.
- USB3_GDSC-supply : phandle to the globally distributed switch controller
  regulator node to the USB controller.
- qcom,dwc_usb3-adc_tm: Corresponding ADC_TM device's phandle to set recurring
		measurements on USB_ID channel when using ADC and receive
		notifications for set thresholds.
- qcom,dwc-usb3-msm-tx-fifo-size: If present, represents RAM size available for
		TX fifo allocation in bytes
- qcom,dwc-usb3-msm-qdss-tx-fifo-size: If present, represent RAM size available
		for TX fifo allocation in QDSS composition
- qcom,restore-sec-cfg-for-scm-dev-id: If present then device id value is
  passed to secure channel manager(scm) driver. scm driver uses this device
  id to restore USB controller related security configuration after coming
  out of the controller power collapse.

Sub nodes:
- Sub node for "DWC3- USB3 controller".
  This sub node is required property for device node. The properties of this subnode
  are specified in dwc3.txt.
