    - qcom,msm-bus,num_cases - There are three valid cases for this: NONE, MAX
		and MIN bandwidth votes. Minimum two cases must be defined for
		both NONE and MAX votes. If MIN vote is different from NONE VOTE
		then specify third case for MIN VOTE. If explicit NOC clock rates
		are not specified then MAX value should be large enough to get
		desired BUS frequencies. In case explicit NOC clock rates are
		specified, peripheral mode bus bandwidth vote should be defined
		to vote for arbitrated bandwidth so that 60MHz frequency is met.

    - qcom,msm-bus,num_paths
    - qcom,msm-bus,vectors
- qcom,hsusb-otg-lpm-on-dev-suspend: If present then USB enter to
	    low power mode upon receiving bus suspend.
- qcom,hsusb-otg-clk-always-on-workaround: If present then USB core clocks
	    remain active upon receiving bus suspend and USB cable is connected.
	    Used for allowing USB to respond for remote wakup.
- qcom,hsusb-otg-delay-lpm: If present then USB core will wait one second
	after disconnect before entering low power mode.

         Optional "supply-name" is "vbus_otg" to supply vbus in host mode.

	and controller driver therefore enables pull-up explicitly before
	starting controller using usbcmd run/stop bit.
- qcom,usb2-enable-hsphy2: If present then USB2 controller is connected to 2nd
	HSPHY.
- qcom,hsusb-log2-itc: value of 2^(log2_itc-1) will be used as the

	configured for detection of dp line transition during VDD minimization.
- qcom,hsusb-otg-mpm-dmsehv-int: If present, indicates mpm interrupt to be
	configured for detection of dm line transition during VDD minimization.
- pinctrl-names : This should be defined if a target uses gpio and pinctrl framework.
  See "pinctrl" in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/msm-pinctrl.txt.
  It should specify the names of the configs that pinctrl can install in driver
	Following are the pinctrl config that can be installed
	"hsusb_active" : Active configuration of pins, this should specify active
	config of vddmin gpio (if used) defined in their pin groups.
	"hsusb_sleep" : Disabled configuration of pins, this should specify sleep
	config of vddmin gpio (if used) defined in their pin groups.
- qcom,hsusb-otg-vddmin-gpio = If present, indicates a gpio that will be used
	to supply voltage to the D+ line during VDD minimization and peripheral
	bus suspend. If not exists, then VDD minimization will not be allowed
	during peripheral bus suspend.
- qcom,hsusb-otg-rw-during-lpm-workaround: If present, indicates that remote-
	wakeup during USB low-power mode SW workaround will be applied. When
	this workaround is applied, the PHCD and the FPR bits are written
	to the PORTSC register in the same register write operation.
- qcom,ahb-async-bridge-bypass: If present, indicates that enable AHB2AHB By Pass
	mode with device controller for better throughput. With this mode, USB Core
	runs using PNOC clock and synchronous to it. Hence it is must to have proper
	"qcom,msm-bus,vectors" to have high bus frequency. User shouldn't try to
	enable this feature without proper bus voting. When this feature is enabled,
	it is required to do HW reset during cable disconnect for host mode functionality
	working and hence need to disable qcom,hsusb-otg-disable-reset. With this feature
	enabled, USB HW has to vote for maximum PNOC frequency as USB HW cannot tolerate
	changes in PNOC frequncy which results in USB functionality failure.
- qcom,disable-retention-with-vdd-min: If present don't allow phy retention but allow
	vdd min.
- qcom,usbin-vadc: Corresponding vadc device's phandle to read usbin voltage using VADC.
	This will be used to get value of usb power supply's VOLTAGE_NOW property.
- qcom,usbid-gpio: This corresponds to gpio which is used for USB ID detection.
- qcom,bus-clk-rate: If present, indicates nominal bus frequency to be voted for
	bimc/snoc/pcnoc clock with usb cable connected. If AHB2AHB bypass is enabled,
	pcnoc value should be defined to very large number so that PNOC runs at max
	frequency.
- qcom,phy-dvdd-always-on: If present PHY DVDD is supplied by a always-on
	regulator unlike vddcx/vddmx. PHY can keep D+ pull-up and D+/D-
	pull-down resistors during peripheral and host bus suspend without
	any re-work.
