MSM USB PHY transceivers

HSUSB PHY

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "qcom,usb-hsphy"
 - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
 - <supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
   Required "supply-name" examples are:
	"vdd" : vdd supply for HSPHY digital circuit operation
	"vdda18" : 1.8v supply for HSPHY
	"vdda33" : 3.3v supply for HSPHY
 - qcom,vdd-voltage-level: This property must be a list of three integer
   values (no, min, max) where each value represents either a voltage in
   microvolts or a value corresponding to voltage corner

Optional properties:
 - reg: Address and length of the TCSR register to be written when performing
   a block reset, as well as to intialize the internal MUX to select the
   correct controller. If present this must be the second register listed.

 - qcom,hsphy-init: Init value used to override HSPHY parameters into
   QSCRATCH register. This 32-bit value represents parameters as follows:
		bits 0-5   PARAMETER_OVERRIDE_A
		bits 6-12  PARAMETER_OVERRIDE_B
		bits 13-19 PARAMETER_OVERRIDE_C
		bits 20-25 PARAMETER_OVERRIDE_D
 - qcom,ext-vbus-id: If present then PHY does not handle VBUS and ID changes.
 - qcom,vbus-valid-override: If present, indicates VBUS pin is not connected to
   the USB PHY and the controller must rely on external VBUS notification in
   order to manually enable the D+ pull-up resistor.

Example:
	hsphy@f9200000 {
		compatible = "qcom,usb-hsphy";
		reg = <0xf9200000 0xfc000>;
		qcom,hsphy-init = <0x00D191A4>;
		vdd-supply = <&pm8841_s2_corner>;
		vdda18-supply = <&pm8941_l6>;
		vdda33-supply = <&pm8941_l24>;
		qcom,vdd-voltage-level = <1 5 7>;
	};

SSUSB PHY

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "qcom,usb-ssphy"
 - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
 - <supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
   Required "supply-name" examples are:
	"vdd" : vdd supply for SSPHY digital circuit operation
	"vdda18" : 1.8v high-voltage analog supply for SSPHY
 - qcom,vdd-voltage-level: This property must be a list of three integer
   values (no, min, max) where each value represents either a voltage in
   microvolts or a value corresponding to voltage corner

Optional properties:
 - qcom,vbus-valid-override: If present, indicates VBUS pin is not connected to
   the USB PHY and the controller must rely on external VBUS notification in
   order to manually relay the notification to the SSPHY.
 - qcom,deemphasis-value: This property if present represents ss phy
   deemphasis value to be used for overriding into SSPHY register.

Example:
	ssphy@f9200000 {
		compatible = "qcom,usb-ssphy";
		reg = <0xf9200000 0xfc000>;
		vdd-supply = <&pm8841_s2_corner>;
		vdda18-supply = <&pm8941_l6>;
		qcom,vdd-voltage-level = <1 5 7>;
		qcom,deemphasis-value = <26>;
	};
