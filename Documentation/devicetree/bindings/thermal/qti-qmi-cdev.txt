QMI thermal mitigation(TMD) cooling devices.

The QMI TMD cooling device, will be used for various mitigations for remote
subsystem including remote processor mitigation, rail voltage restriction etc.
This cooling device uses kernel qti QMI interface to send the message to
remote subsystem.

Each child node of the QMI TMD devicetree node represents each remote
subsystem and each child of this subsystem represents separate cooling
devices. It requires minimum one remote subsystem node and each subsystem
node requires minimum one cooling device node.

Properties:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,qmi-cooling-devices"


Subsystem properties:
- qcom,instance-id:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <integer>
	Definition: Remote subsystem QMI server instance id to be used for
			communicating with QMI.

	Minimum one child node is required. Child node name and its alias are
	used as cooling device name and phandle for that cooling device.

	cooling device node properties:
	-qcom,qmi-dev-name:
		Usage: required
		Value type: <string>
		Definition: Remote subsystem device identifier. Below strings
			are the only acceptable device names,
			"pa" -> for pa cooling device,
			"pa_fr1" -> for pa cooling device,
			"cpuv_restriction_cold" -> for vdd restriction,
			"cx_vdd_limit" -> for vdd limit,
			"modem" -> for processor passive cooling device,
			"modem_current" -> for current limiting device,
			"modem_bw" ->  for bus bandwidth limiting device,
			"vbatt_low" -> BCL vbat mitigation device,
			"mmw0" -> Millimeter wave limiting device 0,
			"mmw1" -> Millimeter wave limiting device 1,
			"mmw2" -> Millimeter wave limiting device 2,
			"mmw3" -> Millimeter wave limiting device 3,
			"modem_skin" -> Modem skin mitigation device,
			"mmw_skin0" -> MMW skin mitigation device0,
			"mmw_skin1" -> MMW skin mitigation device1,
			"mmw_skin2" -> MMW skin mitigation device2,
			"mmw_skin3" -> MMW skin mitigation device3,
			"cpr_cold" -> for cpr restriction.
			"wlan" -> for modem wlan mitigation device.
			"cdsp_sw" -> for CDSP DCVS mitigation device.
			"cdsp_hw" -> for CDSP hardware mitigation device.

	-#cooling-cells:
		Usage: required
		Value type: <integer>
		Definition: Must be 2. Needed for of_thermal as cooling device
			identifier. Please refer to
			<devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt> for more
			details.
