QMI thermal mitigation(TS) sensor.

The QMI TS Sensor driver can list the sensors that are available in the
remote subsystem. This driver can read the temperature, set threshold and
get threshold notification.

Each child node of the QMI TS devicetree node represents a remote
subsystem and it can have more than one remote sensor names.

Properties:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,qmi-sensors"

- #thermal-sensor-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <integer>
	Definition: Must be 1. See thermal.txt for description.

Subsystem properties:
- qcom,instance-id:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <integer>
	Definition: Remote subsystem QMI server instance id to be used for
			communicating with QMI.

- qcom,qmi-sensor-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <array of string>
	Definition: Remote sensor names. Below strings
		are the only acceptable sensor names,
		1. pa
		2. pa1
		3. qfe_pa0
		4. qfe_wtr0

Example:

qmi_sensor: qmi-ts-sensors {
	compatible = "qcom,qmi-sensors";
	#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;

	modem {
		qcom,instance-id = <0x0>;
		qcom,qmi-sensor-names = "pa",
					"pa_1",
					"qfe_pa0",
					"qfe_wtr0";
	};
};
