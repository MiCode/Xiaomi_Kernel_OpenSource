Qualcomm QPNP Temperature Alarm

QPNP temperature alarm peripherals are found inside of Qualcomm PMIC chips that
utilize the MSM SPMI implementation.  These peripherals provide an interrupt
signal and status register to identify high PMIC die temperature.

Required properties:
- compatible:      Must be "qcom,qpnp-temp-alarm".
- reg:             Specifies the SPMI address and size for this temperature
		    alarm device.
- interrupts:      PMIC temperature alarm interrupt
- label:           A string used as a descriptive name for this thermal device.
		    This name should be 19 characters or less.

Required structure:
- A qcom,qpnp-temp-alarm node must be a child of an SPMI node that has specified
   the spmi-slave-container property

Optional properties:
- qcom,channel-num:    VADC channel number associated PMIC DIE_TEMP thermistor.
			If no channel is specified, then the die temperature
			must be estimated based on the over temperature stage.
- qcom,threshold-set:  Integer value which specifies which set of threshold
			temperatures to use for the over temperature stages.
			Possible values (x = {stage 1 threshold temperature,
				stage 2 threshold temperature,
				stage 3 threshold temperature}):
			 0 = {105 C, 125 C, 145 C}
			 1 = {110 C, 130 C, 150 C}
			 2 = {115 C, 135 C, 155 C}
			 3 = {120 C, 140 C, 160 C}
- qcom,clock-rate:     Integer value which specifies the temperature monitoring
			clock rate.  This property is only supported on GEN2
			temperature alarm peripherals.
			Supported values:
			 0 = 100 Hz
			 1 = 50 Hz
			 2 = 25 Hz
			 3 = 12.5 Hz
- qcom,allow-override: Boolean which controls the ability of software to
			override shutdowns.  If present, then software is
			allowed to override automatic PMIC hardware stage 2 and
			stage 3 over temperature shutdowns.  Otherwise, software
			is not allowed to override automatic shutdown.
- qcom,default-temp:   Specifies the default temperature in millicelcius to use
			if no ADC channel is present to read the real time
			temperature.
- qcom,temp_alarm-vadc: Corresponding VADC device's phandle.

Note, if a given optional qcom,* binding is not present, then the default
hardware state for that feature will be maintained.

Example:
&spmi_bus {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <3>;

	qcom,pm8941@0 {
		spmi-slave-container;
		reg = <0x0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		qcom,temp-alarm@2400 {
			compatible = "qcom,qpnp-temp-alarm";
			reg = <0x2400 0x100>;
			interrupts = <0x0 0x24 0x0>;
			label = "pm8941_tz";
			qcom,channel-num = <8>;
			qcom,threshold-set = <0>;
			qcom,temp_alarm-vadc = <&pm8941_vadc>;
		};
	};
};
