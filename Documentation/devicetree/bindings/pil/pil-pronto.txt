* Qualcomm WCNSS Pronto Peripheral Image Loader

pil-pronto is a peripheral image loading (PIL) driver. It is used for loading
Pronto firmware images for wireless connectivity subsystems into memory and
preparing the subsystem's processor to execute code. It is also used for
shutting down the processor when it's not needed.

Required properties:
- compatible: "pil-pronto"
- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device.
- reg-names: names of the bases for the above registers. "pmu_base", "clk_base",
             and "halt_base" are expected.
- interrupts: WCNSS to Apps watchdog bite interrupt
- vdd_pronto_pll-supply: regulator to supply pronto pll.
- qcom,firmware-name: Base name of the firmware image. Ex. "wcnss"

Optional properties:
- qcom,gpio-err-fatal: GPIO used by the wcnss to indicate error fatal to the Apps.
- qcom,gpio-err-ready: GPIO used by the wcnss to indicate error ready to the Apps.
- qcom,gpio-proxy-unvote: GPIO used by the wcnss to trigger proxy unvoting in
  the Apps
- qcom,gpio-stop-ack: GPIO used by wcnss to ack force stop or a graceful stop
  to Apps.
- qcom,gpio-force-stop: GPIO used by the Apps to force the wcnss to shutdown.
- qcom,restart-group: List of subsystems that will need to restart together.

Example:
	qcom,pronto@fb21b000 {
		compatible = "qcom,pil-pronto";
		reg = <0xfb21b000 0x3000>,
		      <0xfc401700 0x4>,
		      <0xfd485300 0xc>;
		reg-names = "pmu_base", "clk_base", "halt_base";
		vdd_pronto_pll-supply = <&pm8941_l12>;
		interrupts = <0 231 1>;

		qcom,firmware-name = "wcnss";

		/* GPIO input from wcnss */
		qcom,gpio-err-fatal = <&smp2pgpio_ssr_smp2p_4_in 0 0>;
		qcom,gpio-err-ready = <&smp2pgpio_ssr_smp2p_4_in 1 0>;
		qcom,proxy-unvote = <&smp2pgpio_ssr_smp2p_4_in 2 0>;
		qcom,gpio-stop-ack = <&smp2pgpio_ssr_smp2p_4_in 3 0>;

		/* GPIO output to wcnss */
		qcom,gpio-force-stop = <&smp2pgpio_ssr_smp2p_4_out 0 0>;
	};
