Qualcomm LPASS QDSP6v5 Peripheral Image Loader

pil-qdsp6v5-lpass is a peripheral image loader (PIL) driver. It is used for
loading QDSP6v5 (Hexagon) firmware images for Low Power Audio Subsystems
into memory and preparing the subsystem's processor to execute code. It's
also responsible for shutting down the processor when it's not needed.

Required properties:
- compatible:	      Must be "qcom,pil-q6v5-lpass"
- reg:		      Pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes of
		      memory mapped registers.
- reg-names:	      Names of the bases for the above registers. "qdsp6_base"
		      and "halt_base" are expected.
- qcom,firmware-name: Base name of the firmware image. Ex. "lpass"

Example:
	qcom,lpass@fe200000 {
	        compatible = "qcom,pil-q6v5-lpass";
	        reg = <0xfe200000 0x00100>,
	              <0xfd485100 0x00010>;
		reg-names = "qdsp6_base", "halt_base";

	        qcom,firmware-name = "lpass";
	};
