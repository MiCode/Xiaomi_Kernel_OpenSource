Qualcomm MSS QDSP6v5 Peripheral Image Loader

pil-qdsp6v5-mss is a peripheral image loader (PIL) driver. It is used for
loading QDSP6v5 (Hexagon) firmware images for modem subsystems into memory and
preparing the subsystem's processor to execute code. It's also responsible for
shutting down the processor when it's not needed.

Required properties:
- compatible:	      Must be "qcom,pil-q6v5-mss" or "qcom,pil-q6v55-mss" or
			"pil-q6v56-mss".
- reg:		      Pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes of
		      memory mapped registers.
- reg-names:	      Names of the bases for the above registers. "qdsp6_base",
		      "rmb_base", "restart_reg" or "restart_reg_sec"(optional
		      for secure mode) are expected.
		      If "halt_base" is in same 4K pages this register then
		      this will be defined else "halt_q6", "halt_modem",
		      "halt_nc" is required.
- interrupts:         The modem watchdog interrupt
- vdd_cx-supply:      Reference to the regulator that supplies the vdd_cx domain.
- vdd_mx-supply:      Reference to the regulator that supplies the memory rail.
- vdd_mx-uV:          Voltage setting for the mx rail.
- qcom,firmware-name: Base name of the firmware image. Ex. "mdsp"

Optional properties:
- vdd_mss-supply:     Reference to the regulator that supplies the processor.
		      This may be a shared regulator that is already voted
		      on in the PIL proxy voting code (and also managed by the
		      modem on its own), hence we mark it as as optional.
- vdd_pll-supply:     Reference to the regulator that supplies the PLL's rail.
- qcom,vdd_pll:       Voltage to be set for the PLL's rail.
- reg-names:          "cxrail_bhs_reg" - control register for modem power
		      domain.
- clocks:	      Array of <clock_controller_phandle clock_reference> listing
		      all the clocks that are accesed by this subsystem.
- qcom,proxy-clock-names:  Names of the clocks that need to be turned on/off during
			   proxy voting/unvoting.
- qcom,active-clock-names: Names of the clocks that need to be turned on for the
			   subsystem to run. Turned off when the subsystem is shutdown.
- clock-names:		   Names of all the clocks that are accessed by the subsystem.
- qcom,is-not-loadable: Boolean- Present if the image does not need to
			be loaded.
- qcom,pil-self-auth: Boolean- True if authentication is required.
- qcom,gpio-err-fatal: GPIO used by the modem to indicate error fatal to the apps.
- qcom,gpio-err-ready: GPIO used by the modem to indicate error ready to the apps.
- qcom,gpio-proxy-unvote: GPIO used by the modem to trigger proxy unvoting in
  the apps.
- qcom,gpio-force-stop: GPIO used by the apps to force the modem to shutdown.
- qcom,gpio-stop-ack: GPIO used by the modem to ack force stop or a graceful stop
		      to the apps.
- qcom,gpio-ramdump-disable: GPIO used by the modem to inform the apps that ramdump
			     collection should be disabled.
- qcom,restart-group: List of subsystems that will need to restart together.
- qcom,mba-image-is-not-elf:	Boolean- Present if MBA image doesnt use the ELF
				format.
- qcom,ssctl-instance-id: Instance id used by the subsystem to connect with the SSCTL
			  service.
- qcom,sysmon-id:	platform device id that sysmon is probed with for the subsystem.
- qcom,override-acc: Boolean- Present if we need to override the default ACC settings
- qcom,ahb-clk-vote: Boolean- Present if we need to remove the vote for the mss_cfg_ahb
		     clock after the modem boots up
- qcom,qdsp6v56-1-3: Boolean- Present if the qdsp version is v56 1.3
One child node to represent the MBA image may be specified, when the MBA
image needs to be loaded in a specifically carved out memory region.

Required properties:
- compatible:              Must be "qcom,pil-mba-mem"
- linux,contiguous-region: A phandle that points to a memory heap where the MBA
                          image will be loaded
