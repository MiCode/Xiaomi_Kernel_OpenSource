Qualcomm MSS QDSP6v5 Peripheral Image Loader

pil-qdsp6v5-mss is a peripheral image loader (PIL) driver. It is used for
loading QDSP6v5 (Hexagon) firmware images for modem subsystems into memory and
preparing the subsystem's processor to execute code. It's also responsible for
shutting down the processor when it's not needed.

Required properties:
- compatible:	      Must be "qcom,pil-q6v5-mss"
- reg:		      Four pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes of
		      memory mapped registers. The first region corresponds to
		      QDSP6SS_PUB, the second to the bus port halt register
		      base, the third to the MSS_RELAY_MSG_BUFFER base, and the
		      fourth to the MSS_RESTART register.
- vdd_mss-supply:     Reference to the regulator that supplies the processor.
- qcom,firmware-name: Base name of the firmware image. Ex. "mdsp"
- qcom,pil-self-auth: <0> if the hardware does not require self-authenticating
		      images and self-authentication is not desired;
		      <1> if the hardware requires self-authenticating images.

Example:
	qcom,mss@fc880000 {
		compatible = "qcom,pil-q6v5-mss";
		reg = <0xfc880000 0x100>,
		      <0xfd485000 0x400>,
		      <0xfc820000 0x020>,
		      <0xfc401680 0x004>;
		vdd_mss-supply = <&pm8841_s3>;

		qcom,firmware-name = "mba";
		qcom,pil-self-auth = <1>;
	};
