* Generic Subsystem Peripheral Image Loader

subsys-pil-tz is a generic peripheral image loader (PIL) driver. It is
used for loading the firmware images of the subsystems into memory and
preparing the subsystem's processor to execute code. It's also responsible
for shutting down the processor when it's not needed.

Required properties:
- compatible:	      Must be "qcom,pil-tz-generic"
- qcom,firmware-name: Base name of the firmware image.

Optional properties:
- reg:		      Pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes of
		      memory mapped registers.
- interrupts:	      Subsystem to Apps watchdog bite interrupt.
- vdd_'reg'-supply:   Reference to the regulator that supplies the corresponding
		      'reg' domain.
- proxy-reg-names:    Names of the regulators that need to be turned on/off
		      during proxy voting/unvoting.
- active-reg-names:   Names of the regulators that need to be turned on for the
		      subsystem to run. Turned off when the subsystem is shutdown.
- vdd_'reg'-uV-uA:    Voltage and current values for the 'reg' regulator.
- proxy-clock-names:  Names of the clocks that need to be turned on/off during
		      proxy voting/unvoting.
- active-clock-names: Names of the clocks that need to be turned on for the
		      subsystem to run. Turned off when the subsystem is shutdown.
- clock-names:	      Names of all the clocks that are accessed by the subsystem.
- qcom,msm-bus,name:  Name of the bus client for the subsystem.
- qcom,msm-bus,num-cases: Number of use-cases.
- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths: Number of paths.
- qcom,msm-bus,active-only: If not set, uses the dual context by default.
- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps: Vector array of master id, slave id, arbitrated
			     bandwidth and instantaneous bandwidth.
- qcom,pas-id:	      pas_id of the subsystem.
- qcom,proxy-timeout-ms: Proxy vote timeout value for the subsystem.
- qcom,smem-id:	      ID of the SMEM item for the subsystem.
- qcom,is-not-loadable: Boolean. Present if the subsystem's firmware image does not
			need to	be loaded.
- qcom,pil-self-auth: Boolean. Present if the subsystem can authenticate itself.
- qcom,gpio-err-fatal: GPIO used by the subsystem to indicate error fatal to the apps.
- qcom,gpio-err-ready: GPIO used by the subsystem to indicate error ready to the apps.
- qcom,gpio-proxy-unvote: GPIO used by the subsystem to trigger proxy unvoting in
			  the apps.
- qcom,gpio-force-stop: GPIO used by the apps to force the subsystem to shutdown.
- qcom,gpio-stop-ack: GPIO used by the subsystem to ack force stop or a graceful stop
		      to the apps.
- qcom,restart-group: List of subsystems that will need to restart together.
