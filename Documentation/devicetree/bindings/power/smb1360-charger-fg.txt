SMB1360 battery charger and fuel gauge

SMB1360 is a single path switch-mode battery charger and
fuel gauge. The charger has a max current rating of 1.5A.
The fuel gauge uses voltage + coulomb counting to report
the state of charge.

The smb1360 interface is via I2C bus.

Required Properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,smb1360-charger-fg"
- reg:				The device 7-bit I2C address.

Optional Properties:

- interrupts			This indicates the IRQ number of the GPIO
				connected to the STAT pin.
- pinctrl-names:		The state name of the pin configuration. Only
				support: "default".
- pinctrl-0:			The phandle of the pin configuration node in
				pinctrl for smb_int_pin.
				For details of pinctrl properties, please refer to:
				"Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt"
- qcom,float-voltage-mv	 	Float Voltage in mV - the maximum voltage up to which
				the battery is charged. Supported range 3460V to 4360V
- qcom,charging-timeout		Maximum duration in minutes that a single charge
				cycle may last.  Supported values are: 0, 192, 384,
				768, and 1536.  A value of 0 means that no
				charge cycle timeout is used and charging can
				continue indefinitely.
- qcom,charging-disabled		Set this if charging should be disabled in the build
				by default. Useful in usecases where battery current
				needs to be profiled even when USB is present.
- qcom,recharge-thresh-mv	Specifies the minimum voltage drop in millivolts
				below the float voltage that is required in
				order to initiate a new charging cycle.
				Supported values are: 50, 100, 200 and 300mV.
- qcom,recharge-disabled		Disabled the auto-recharge function
- qcom,iterm-ma			Specifies the termination current to indicate end-of-charge.
				Possible values in mA - 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200
- qcom,iterm-disabled		Disables the termination current feature. This is a bool
				property.
- qcom,chg-inhibit-disabled	Disables the charger-inhibit function.
- qcom,batt-id-disabled		Disabled the batt-id function. Doing this will
				disable the ability of RID based battery profile selection.
- qcom,fg-delta-soc		The delta in SOC which will generate an interrupt
- qcom,fg-soc-max		SOC value (max) at which an interrupt is generated.
				This can be used to alert the system when the
				battery reaches a specifc (maximum) SOC value.
- qcom,fg-soc-min		SOC value (min) at which an interrupt is generated.
				This can be used to alert the system when the
				battery reaches a specific (minimum) SOC value.
- qcom,fg-voltage-min-mv	The minimum volatge at which an interrupt is generated.
				This can be used as an alert mechanism.
- qcom,fg-voltage-empty-mv	The voltage which indicates the battery is empty.
- qcom,thermal-mitigation:	Array of input current limit values for different
				system thermal mitigation level.
- qcom,stat-pulsed-irq:		A boolean flag to indicate the state-irq pin will generate pulse
				signal when interrupt happened. If this property is not specified,
				the default configuration is static level irq.
- qcom,shdn-after-pwroff:	A bool property to configure smb1360 for shutdown at power-off.

			interrupt-parent = <&spmi_bus>;
			interrupts = <0x00 0xcd 0>;
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&smb_int_default>;
			qcom,float-voltage-mv = <4200>;
			qcom,iterm-ma = <100>;
			qcom,charging-disabled;
			qcom,recharge-thresh-mv = <100>;
			qcom,fg-soc-max = <85>;
			qcom,fg-soc-min = <15>;
			qcom,thermal-mitigation = <1500 700 300 0>;
		};
