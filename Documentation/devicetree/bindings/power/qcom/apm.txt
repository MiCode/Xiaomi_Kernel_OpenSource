MSM Array Power Mux (msm-apm)

In some MSM designs, the CPU and caches contain logic which can be powered by
multiple rails. The APM controller exists to enable the selection of the power
rail supplying these arrays. Since a given supply may drop below the array
SRAM minimum operating voltage, the APM controller can be used to request a
switch to a power supply that will guarantee logic state retention.

Required properties
- compatible:	"qcom,msm-apm"
- reg:		Specifies physical base address and size of memory mapped regions
		containing the APM controller, APCS CSR, APC PLL controller, and
		SPM event registers.
- reg-names:	List of strings identifying the reg property entries. This list must
		contain: "pm-apcc-glb", "apcs-csr", "apc0-pll-ctl", "apc1-pll-ctl",
		"apc0-cpu0-spm", "apc0-cpu1-spm", "apc1-cpu0-spm", "apc1-cpu1-spm",
		"apc0-l2-spm", and "apc1-l2-spm".

Optional properties
- qcom,clock-source-override:	Specify this property to request a switch of the APC0 and APC1
				clock sources to GPLL0 before the APM switch begins and to
				switch back to the original clock source after the APM switch
				completes.
