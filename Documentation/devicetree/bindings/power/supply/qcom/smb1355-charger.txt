Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SMB1355 Charger Specific Bindings

SMB1355 slave charger is paired with QTI family of standalone chargers to
enable a high current, low profile Li+ battery charging system.

The device provides 28V DC withstand, wide operating input range of 3.8 to
14.2V for standard 5V USB inputs as well as a wide variety of HVDCP Travel
Adapters and is compatible with QTI's Quick Charge technology.

=======================
Required Node Structure
=======================

SMB1355 Charger must be described in two levels of device nodes.

==================================
First Level Node - SMB1355 Charger
==================================

Charger specific properties:
- compatible
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: "qcom,smb1355".

- qcom,pmic-revid
  Usage:      required
  Value type: phandle
  Definition: Should specify the phandle of SMB's revid module. This is used
	      to identify the SMB subtype.

- qcom,disable-ctm
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <empty>
  Definition: boolean flag. Usually a thermistor near usb/typeC connector is
	      connected to AUX. Set this flag to indicate the thermistor
	      doesn't exist.

- qcom,parallel-mode
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: Specifies parallel charging mode. If not specified, MID-MID
              option is selected by default.

- qcom,stacked-batfet
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <empty>
  Definition: boolean flag. Specifies if parallel charger has stacked BATFET
              configuration.
	      In stacked batfet the main and parallel charger's batfet are
	      stacked one after the other and thus all the charge current
	      (FCC) flows through main. In a non-stacked configuration each
	      charger controls the charge current (FCC) separately.

- qcom,die-temp-threshold-degc
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: Specifies DIE temp threshold beyond which h/w starts mitigation.
	      If not sepcified, 90 degrees centigrade is used.

- qcom,hw-die-temp-mitigation
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: bool
  Definition: Boolean property to enable h/w controlled die temp mitigation.

- pinctrl-names
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <string-list>
  Definition: Should be "default".
		Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt

- pinctrl-0
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <phandle-list>
  Definition: phandle of the pin configuration.
		Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt

================================================
Second Level Nodes - SMB1355 Charger Peripherals
================================================

Peripheral specific properties:
- reg
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  Definition: Address and size of the peripheral's register block.

- interrupts
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  Definition: Peripheral interrupt specifier.

- interrupt-names
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <stringlist>
  Definition: Interrupt names.  This list must match up 1-to-1 with the
	      interrupts specified in the 'interrupts' property.

Example

smb1355_charger: qcom,smb1355-charger {
	compatible = "qcom,smb1355";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;

	qcom,chgr-misc@1600 {
		reg = <0x1600 0x100>;

		interrupt-names = "wdog-bark";
