Qualcomm Techonologies, Inc. QPNP PMIC Fuel Gauge Gen3 Device

QPNP PMIC FG Gen3 device provides interface to the clients to read properties
related to the battery. Its main function is to retrieve the State of Charge
(SOC), in percentage scale representing the amount of charge left in the
battery.

level describes the FG Gen3 device.  The second level describes one or more
peripherals managed by FG Gen3 driver. All the peripheral specific parameters
such as base address, interrupts etc., should be under second level node.
