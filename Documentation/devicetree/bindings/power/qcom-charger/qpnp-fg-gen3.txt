Qualcomm Techonologies, Inc. QPNP PMIC Fuel Gauge Gen3 Device

QPNP PMIC FG Gen3 device provides interface to the clients to read properties
related to the battery. Its main function is to retrieve the State of Charge
(SOC), in percentage scale representing the amount of charge left in the
battery.

=======================
Required Node Structure
=======================

FG Gen3 device must be described in two levels of device nodes.  The first
level describes the FG Gen3 device.  The second level describes one or more
peripherals managed by FG Gen3 driver. All the peripheral specific parameters
such as base address, interrupts etc., should be under second level node.

====================================
First Level Node - FG Gen3 device
====================================

- compatible
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Should be "qcom,fg-gen3".

- qcom,pmic-revid
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: Should specify the phandle of PMIC revid module. This is
		    used to identify the PMIC subtype.

- io-channels
- io-channel-names
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: For details about IIO bindings see:
		    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/iio-bindings.txt

- qcom,fg-cutoff-voltage
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: The voltage (in mV) where the fuel gauge will steer the SOC
		    to be zero. For example, if the cutoff voltage is set to
		    3400mv, the fuel gauge will try to count SoC so that the
		    battery SOC will be 0 when it is 3400mV. If this property
		    is not specified, then the default value used will be
		    3200mV.

- qcom,fg-empty-voltage
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: The voltage threshold (in mV) based on which the empty soc
		    interrupt will be triggered. When the empty soc interrupt
		    fires, battery soc will be set to 0 and the userspace will
		    be notified via the power supply framework. The userspace
		    will read 0% soc and immediately shutdown. If this property
		    is not specified, then the default value used will be
		    3100mV.

- qcom,fg-vbatt-low-thr
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: The voltage threshold (in mV) which upon set will be used
		    for configuring the low battery voltage threshold.

- qcom,fg-chg-term-current
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Battery current (in mA) at which the fuel gauge will issue
		    an end of charge if the charger is configured to use the
		    fuel gauge ADC for end of charge detection. If this
		    property is not specified, then the default value used
		    will be 100mA.

- qcom,fg-sys-term-current
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Battery current (in mA) at which the fuel gauge will try to
		    scale towards 100%. When the charge current goes above this
		    the SOC should be at 100%. If this property is not
		    specified, then the default value used will be 125mA.

- qcom,fg-delta-soc-thr
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Percentage of monotonic SOC increase upon which the delta
		    SOC interrupt will be triggered. If this property is not
		    specified, then the default value will be 1.

- qcom,fg-recharge-soc-thr
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Percentage of monotonic SOC upon which the charging will
		    will be resumed once the charging is complete. If this
		    property is not specified, then the default value will be
		    95.

- qcom,fg-rsense-sel
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Specifies the source of sense resistor.
		    Allowed values are:
		    0 - Rsense is from Battery FET
		    1 - Rsense is external
		    2 - Rsense is Battery FET and SMB
		    Option 2 can be used only when a parallel charger is
		    present. If this property is not specified, then the
		    default value will be 2.

- qcom,fg-jeita-thresholds
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of integers which holds the jeita thresholds (degC)
		    in the following order. Allowed size is 4.
		    Element 0 - JEITA cold threshold
		    Element 1 - JEITA cool threshold
		    Element 2 - JEITA warm threshold
		    Element 3 - JEITA hot threshold
		    If these parameters are not specified, then the default
		    values used will be 0, 5, 45, 50.

- qcom,fg-esr-timer-charging
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Number of cycles between ESR pulses while the battery is
		    charging.

- qcom,fg-esr-timer-awake
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Number of cycles between ESR pulses while the system is
		    awake and the battery is discharging.

- qcom,fg-esr-timer-asleep
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Number of cycles between ESR pulses while the system is
		    asleep and the battery is discharging. This option requires
		    qcom,fg-esr-timer-awake to be defined.

==========================================================
Second Level Nodes - Peripherals managed by FG Gen3 driver
==========================================================
- reg
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Addresses and sizes for the specified peripheral

- interrupts
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Interrupt mapping as per the interrupt encoding

- interrupt-names
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Interrupt names.  This list must match up 1-to-1 with the
		    interrupts specified in the 'interrupts' property.
