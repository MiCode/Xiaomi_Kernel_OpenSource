QPNP Qnovo pulse engine

QPNP Qnovo is a pulse charging engine which works in tandem with the QPNP SMB2
Charger device. It configures the QPNP SMB2 charger to charge/discharge as per
pulse characteristics.

The QPNP Qnovo pulse engine has a single peripheral assigned to it.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,qpnp-qnovo"
- qcom,pmic-revid:	Should specify the phandle of PMIC
			revid module. This is used to identify
			the PMIC subtype.

- reg:			The address for this peripheral
- interrupts:		Specifies the interrupt associated with the peripheral.
- interrupt-names:	Specifies the interrupt name for the peripheral. Qnovo
			peripheral has only one interrupt "ptrain-done".

Optional Properties:
- qcom,external-rsense:		To indicate whether the platform uses external or
				internal rsense for measuring battery current.

Example:

	qcom,qpnp-qnovo@1500 {
		compatible = "qcom,qpnp-qnovo";
		reg = <0x1500 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0x2 0x15 0x0 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
		interrupt-names = "ptrain-done";
		qcom,pmic-revid = <&pmi8998_revid>;
	};
