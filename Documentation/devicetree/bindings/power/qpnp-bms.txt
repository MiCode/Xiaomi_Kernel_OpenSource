Qualcomm's QPNP PMIC Battery Management System driver

QPNP PMIC BMS provides interface to clients to read properties related
to the battery. It's main function is to calculate the State of Charge (SOC),
a 0-100 percentage representing the amount of charge left in the battery.

BMS node

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "qcom,qpnp-bms" for the BM driver.
- reg : offset and length of the PMIC BMS register map.
- interrupts : the interrupt mappings for bms.
		The format should be
		<slave-id peripheral-id interrupt-number>.
- interrupt-names : names for the mapped bms interrupt
		The following interrupts are required:
		0 : vsense_for_r
		1 : vsense_avg
		2 : sw_cc_thr
		3 : ocv_thr
		4 : charge_begin
		5 : good_ocv
		6 : ocv_for_r
		7 : cc_thr
- qcom,bms-r-sense-mohm : sensor resistance in in milli-ohms.
- qcom,bms-v-cutoff-uv : cutoff voltage where the battery is considered dead in
			micro-volts.
- qcom,bms-max-voltage-uv : maximum voltage for the battery in micro-volts.
- qcom,bms-r-conn-mohm : connector resistance in milli-ohms.
- qcom,bms-shutdown-soc-valid-limit : If the ocv upon restart is within this
			distance of the shutdown ocv, the BMS will try to force
			the new SoC to the old one to provide charge continuity.
			That is to say,
				if (abs(shutdown-soc - current-soc) < limit)
				then use old SoC.
- qcom,bms-adjust-soc-low-threshold : The low threshold for the "flat portion"
			of the charging curve. The BMS will not adjust SoC
			based on voltage during this time.
- qcom,bms-adjust-soc-high-threshold :  The high threshold for the "flat
			portion" of the charging curve. The BMS will not
			adjust SoC based on voltage during this time.
- qcom,bms-chg-term-ua : current in micro-amps when charging is considered done.
			As soon as current passes this point, charging is
			stopped.

Example:
	bms@4000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		compatible = "qcom,qpnp-bms";
		reg = <0x4000 0x100>;

		interrupts =	<0x0 0x40 0x0>,
				<0x0 0x40 0x1>,
				<0x0 0x40 0x2>,
				<0x0 0x40 0x3>,
				<0x0 0x40 0x4>,
				<0x0 0x40 0x5>,
				<0x0 0x40 0x6>,
				<0x0 0x40 0x7>;

		interrupt-names = "vsense_for_r",
				  "vsense_avg",
				  "sw_cc_thr",
				  "ocv_thr",
				  "charge_begin",
				  "good_ocv",
				  "ocv_for_r",
				  "cc_thr";

		qcom,bms-r-sense-mohm = <10>;
		qcom,bms-v-cutoff-uv = <3400000>;
