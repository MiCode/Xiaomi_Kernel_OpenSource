QTI's QPNP PMIC Fuel Gauge Device

QPNP PMIC FG provides interface to clients to read properties related
to the battery. Its main function is to retrieve the State of Charge (SOC),
a 0-100 percentage representing the amount of charge left in the battery.

There are two required peripherals in the FG driver, both implemented as
subnodes in the example. These peripherals must not be disabled if the FG
device is to enabled:

- qcom,fg-soc : The main FG device. Supports battery fuel gauge controls and
		sensors.
- qcom,fg-batt : The FG battery device supports interrupts and controls with
		respect to the state of the connected battery.For example: the
		peripheral informs the driver if the battery has been identified
		by the fuel gauge based on a given battery resistance range.

Optionally ADC nodes can be added
- qcom,fg-adc-vbat : A subnode with a register address for the FG_ADC_USR
		peripheral which is used mainly for battery current limiting (BCL).
		This node maps out the VBAT reading register which allows to have
		a +/- 32 mV accurate reading of VBAT.
- qcom,fg-adc-ibat : A subnode with a register address for the FG_ADC_USR
		peripheral which is used mainly for battery current limiting (BCL).
		This node maps out the IBAT current reading register which allows
		to have a +/- 32 mA accurate reading of IBAT.

Parent node required properties:
- compatible : should be "qcom,qpnp-fg" for the FG driver.

Parent node optional properties:
- qcom,warm-bat-decidegc:		Warm battery temperature in decidegC.
- qcom,cool-bat-decidegc:		Cool battery temperature in decidegC.
- qcom,hot-bat-decidegc:		Hot battery temperature in decidegC.
- qcom,cold-bat-decidegc:		Cold battery temperature in decidegC.
- qcom,ext-sense-type:			Current sense channel used by the FG.
					Set this to use external rsense.
- qcom,thermal-coefficients:		Byte array of thermal coefficients for
					reading battery thermistor. This should
					be exactly 6 bytes in length.
					Example: [01 02 03 04 05 06]
- qcom,resume-soc:			soc to resume charging in percentage.
- qcom,bcl-lm-threshold-ma:		BCL LPM to MPM mode transition threshold
					in milliAmpere.
- qcom,bcl-mh-threshold-ma:		BCL MPM to HPM mode transition threshold
					in milliAmpere.
- qcom,use-otp-profile:			Specify this flag to avoid RAM loading
					any battery profile.
- qcom,sw-rbias-control:		Boolean property which defines whether
					the Rbias needs to be controlled by
					software. If this is not set, it will
					be controlled by hardware (default).
- qcom,fg-iterm-ma:			Battery current at which the fuel gauge
					will issue end of charge if the charger
					is configured to use the fuel gauge
					ADCs for end of charge detection. This
					property is in milliamps and should be
					positive (e.g. 100mA to terminate at
					-100mA).
- qcom,irq-volt-empty-mv:		The voltage threshold that the empty
					soc interrupt will be triggered. When
					the empty soc interrupt fires, battery
					soc will be pulled to 0 and the
					userspace will be notified via the
					power supply framework. The userspace
					will read 0% soc and immediately
					shutdown.

qcom,fg-soc node required properties:
- reg : offset and length of the PMIC peripheral register map.
- interrupts : the interrupt mappings.
		The format should be
		<slave-id peripheral-id interrupt-number>.
- interrupt-names : names for the mapped fg soc interrupts
		The following interrupts are required:
		0: high-soc
		1: low-soc
		2: full-soc
		3: empty-soc
		4: delta-soc
		5: first-est-done
		6: sw-fallbk-ocv
		7: sw-fallbk-new-battrt-sts

qcom,fg-memif node required properties:
- reg : offset and length of the PMIC peripheral register map.
- interrupts : the interrupt mappings.
		The format should be
		<slave-id peripheral-id interrupt-number>.
- interrupt-names : names for the mapped fg adc interrupts
		The following interrupts are required:
		0: mem-avail
