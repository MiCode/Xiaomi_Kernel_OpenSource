* ARM System MMU Architecture Implementation

ARM SoCs may contain an implementation of the ARM System Memory
Management Unit Architecture, which can be used to provide 1 or 2 stages
of address translation to bus masters external to the CPU.

The SMMU may also raise interrupts in response to various fault
conditions.

** System MMU required properties:

- compatible    : Should be one of:

                        "arm,smmu-v1"
                        "arm,smmu-v2"
                        "arm,mmu-400"
                        "arm,mmu-401"
                        "arm,mmu-500"
                        "cavium,smmu-v2"
                        "qcom,qsmmu-v500"
                        "qcom,smmu-v2"

                  depending on the particular implementation and/or the
                  version of the architecture implemented.

                  Qcom SoCs must contain, as below, SoC-specific compatibles
                  along with "qcom,smmu-v2":
                  "qcom,msm8996-smmu-v2", "qcom,smmu-v2",
                  "qcom,sdm845-smmu-v2", "qcom,smmu-v2".

                  Qcom SoCs implementing "arm,mmu-500" must also include,
                  as below, SoC-specific compatibles:
                  "qcom,sdm845-smmu-500", "arm,mmu-500"

- reg           : Base address and size of the SMMU.

- reg-names	: For the "qcom,qsmmu-v500" device "tcu-base" is expected.

- #global-interrupts : The number of global interrupts exposed by the
                       device.

- interrupts    : Interrupt list, with the first #global-irqs entries
                  corresponding to the global interrupts and any
                  following entries corresponding to context interrupts,
                  specified in order of their indexing by the SMMU.

                  For SMMUv2 implementations, there must be exactly one
                  interrupt per context bank. In the case of a single,
                  combined interrupt, it must be listed multiple times.

- #iommu-cells  : See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/iommu.txt
                  for details. With a value of 1, each IOMMU specifier
                  represents a distinct stream ID emitted by that device
                  into the relevant SMMU.

                  SMMUs with stream matching support and complex masters
                  may use a value of 2, where the second cell of the
                  IOMMU specifier represents an SMR mask to combine with
                  the ID in the first cell.  Care must be taken to ensure
                  the set of matched IDs does not result in conflicts.

** System MMU optional properties:

- dma-coherent  : Present if page table walks made by the SMMU are
                  cache coherent with the CPU.

                  NOTE: this only applies to the SMMU itself, not
                  masters connected upstream of the SMMU.

- calxeda,smmu-secure-config-access : Enable proper handling of buggy
                  implementations that always use secure access to
                  SMMU configuration registers. In this case non-secure
                  aliases of secure registers have to be used during
                  SMMU configuration.

- stream-match-mask : For SMMUs supporting stream matching and using
                  #iommu-cells = <1>, specifies a mask of bits to ignore
		  when matching stream IDs (e.g. this may be programmed
		  into the SMRn.MASK field of every stream match register
		  used). For cases where it is desirable to ignore some
                  portion of every Stream ID (e.g. for certain MMU-500
                  configurations given globally unique input IDs). This
                  property is not valid for SMMUs using stream indexing,
                  or using stream matching with #iommu-cells = <2>, and
                  may be ignored if present in such cases.

- clock-names:    List of the names of clocks input to the device. The
                  required list depends on particular implementation and
                  is as follows:
                  - for "qcom,smmu-v2":
                    - "bus": clock required for downstream bus access and
                             for the smmu ptw,
                    - "iface": clock required to access smmu's registers
                               through the TCU's programming interface.
                  - unspecified for other implementations.

- clocks:         Specifiers for all clocks listed in the clock-names property,
                  as per generic clock bindings.

- power-domains:  Specifiers for power domains required to be powered on for
                  the SMMU to operate, as per generic power domain bindings.

- attach-impl-defs : global registers to program at device attach
                  time. This should be a list of 2-tuples of the format:
                  <offset reg_value>.

- qcom,fatal-asf : Enable BUG_ON for address size faults.  Some hardware
                  requires special fixups to recover from address size
                  faults.  Rather than applying the fixups just BUG since
                  address size faults are due to a fundamental programming
                  error from which we don't care about recovering anyways.

- qcom,skip-init : Disable resetting configuration for all context banks
                  during device reset.  This is useful for targets where
                  some context banks are dedicated to other execution
                  environments outside of Linux and those other EEs are
                  programming their own stream match tables, SCTLR, etc.
                  Without setting this option we will trample on their
                  configuration.

- qcom,use-3-lvl-tables:
		  Some hardware configurations may not be optimized for using
		  a four level page table configuration. Set to use a three
		  level page table instead.

- qcom,no-asid-retention:
		  Some hardware may lose internal state for asid after
		  retention. No cache invalidation operations involving asid
		  may be used.

- qcom,split-tables:
		  Some hardware configurations can easily use a model where
		  the I/O virtual address space for a domain can be split into
		  two symmetric portions, and clients can manage each portion.
		  Set for hardware that supports this model, and requires
		  this feature.

- qcom,actlr:
		  An array of <sid mask actlr-setting>.
		  Any sid X for which X&~mask==sid will be programmed with the
		  given actlr-setting.

-qcom,disable-atos:
		  Some hardware may not have full support for atos debugging
		  in tandem with other features like power collapse.

-qcom,opt-out-tbu-halting:
		  Allow certain TBUs to opt-out from being halted for the
		  ATOS operation to proceed. Halting certain TBUs would cause
		  considerable impact to the system such as deadlocks on demand.
		  Such TBUs can be opted out to be halted from software.

- qcom,deferred-regulator-disable-delay : The time delay for deferred regulator
                  disable in ms. In case of unmap call, regulator is
                  enabled/disabled. This may introduce additional delay. For
                  clients who do not detach, it's not possible to keep regulator
                  vote while smmu is attached. Type is <u32>.

- qcom,iommu-geometry:
		  Allow clients to set the available IOVA space for fastmap
		  clients. The new space created will be a superset of the IOVA
		  range which was created through the qcom,iommu-dma-addr-pool
		  DT property.

- (%s)-supply   : Phandle of the regulator that should be powered on during
                  SMMU register access. (%s) is a string from the
		  qcom,regulator-names property.

- qcom,regulator-names :
		  List of strings to use with the (%s)-supply property.

- interconnects:
		  Pairs of phandles and interconnect provider specifier to
		  denote the edge source and destination ports of the
		  interconnect path. For more information, please see
		  bindings/interconnect/interconnect.txt

- qcom,active-only:
		  Boolean property which denotes that interconnect votes
		  should be maintained while the CPUSS is awake
		  (active context). The absence of this property makes it so
		  that interconnect votes will be maintained irrespective of
		  the CPUSS' state (awake or asleep).

** Deprecated properties:

- mmu-masters (deprecated in favour of the generic "iommus" binding) :
                  A list of phandles to device nodes representing bus
                  masters for which the SMMU can provide a translation
                  and their corresponding Stream IDs. Each device node
                  linked from this list must have a "#stream-id-cells"
                  property, indicating the number of Stream ID
                  arguments associated with its phandle.

* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. MMU-500 TBU Device

The qcom,qsmmu-v500 device implements a number of register regions containing
debug functionality. Each register region maps to a separate tbu from the
arm mmu-500 implementation.

** TBU required properties:

- compatible    : Should be one of:
                        "qcom,qsmmuv500-tbu"

- reg           : Base address and size.

- reg-names	: "base" and "status-reg" are expected
		"base" is the main TBU register region.
		"status-reg" indicates whether hw can process a new request.

-qcom,stream-id-range:
		Pair of values describing the smallest supported stream-id
		and the size of the entire set.

Example:
smmu {
	compatible = "qcom,qsmmu-v500";
	tbu@0x1000 {
		compatible = "qcom,qsmmuv500-tbu";
		regs = <0x1000 0x1000>,
			<0x2000 0x8>;
		reg-names = "base",
			"status-reg";
		qcom,stream-id-range = <0x800 0x400>;
	};
};
