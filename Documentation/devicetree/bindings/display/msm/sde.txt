Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SDE KMS

Snapdragon Display Engine implements Linux DRM/KMS APIs to drive user
interface to different panel interfaces. SDE driver is the core of
display subsystem which manage all data paths to different panel interfaces.

Required properties
- compatible: Must be "qcom,sde-kms"
- reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- reg-names : Names to refer to register sets related to this device
- clocks: List of Phandles for clock device nodes
    needed by the device.
- clock-names: List of clock names needed by the device.
- mmagic-supply: Phandle for mmagic mdss supply regulator device node.
- vdd-supply: Phandle for vdd regulator device node.
- interrupt-parent: Must be core interrupt controller.
- interrupts: Interrupt associated with MDSS.
- interrupt-controller: Mark the device node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells: Should be one. The first cell is interrupt number.
- iommus: Specifies the SID's used by this context bank.

Optional properties:
- clock-rate:		List of clock rates in Hz.
- clock-max-rate:	List of maximum clock rate in Hz that this device supports.
- qcom,platform-supply-entries:	A node that lists the elements of the supply. There
				can be more than one instance of this binding,
				in which case the entry would be appended with
				the supply entry index.
				e.g. qcom,platform-supply-entry@0
				-- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device.
				-- qcom,supply-name: name of the supply (vdd/vdda/vddio)
				-- qcom,supply-min-voltage: minimum voltage level (uV)
				-- qcom,supply-max-voltage: maximum voltage level (uV)
				-- qcom,supply-enable-load: load drawn (uA) from enabled supply
				-- qcom,supply-disable-load: load drawn (uA) from disabled supply
				-- qcom,supply-pre-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning on
				-- qcom,supply-post-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning on
				-- qcom,supply-pre-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning off
				-- qcom,supply-post-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning off
- qcom,sde-reg-bus:		Property to provide Bus scaling for register access for
				mdss blocks.


Bus Scaling Data:
- qcom,msm-bus,name:		String property describing client name.
- qcom,msm-bus,num-cases:	This is the the number of Bus Scaling use cases
				defined in the vectors property.
- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths:	This represents the number of paths in each
				Bus Scaling Usecase.
- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps:	* A series of 4 cell properties, with a format
				of (src, dst, ab, ib) which is defined at
				Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt
				* Current values of src & dst are defined at
				include/linux/msm-bus-board.h
