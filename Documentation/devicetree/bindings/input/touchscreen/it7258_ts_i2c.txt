ITE Tech. touch controller

The ITE Tech. touch controller is connected to host processor
via i2c. The controller generates interrupts when the user
touches the panel. The host controller is expected to read
the touch coordinates over i2c and pass the coordinates to
the rest of the system.

Required properties:

 - compatible		: should be "ite,it7260_ts"
 - reg			: i2c slave address of the device
 - interrupt-parent	: parent of interrupt
 - interrupts		: touch sample interrupt to indicate presence or release
			  of fingers on the panel.
 - ite,irq-gpio		: irq gpio which is to provide interrupts to host,
			  same as "interrupts" node. It will also
			  contain active low or active high information.
 - ite,reset-gpio	: reset gpio to control the reset of chip

Optional properties:
 - avdd-supply		: Analog power supply needed to power device
 - vdd-supply		: Power source required to pull up i2c bus
 - ite,wakeup		: boolean, use this to support touch-to-wake feature.

Example:
	i2c@f9927000 {
            it7260@46 {
                    compatible = "ite,it7260_ts";
                    reg = <0x46>;
                    interrupt-parent = <&msmgpio>;
                    interrupts = <17 0x2>;
                    avdd-supply = <&pm8226_l19>;
                    vdd-supply = <&pm8226_lvs1>;
                    ite,reset-gpio = <&msmgpio 16 0x00>;
                    ite,irq-gpio = <&msmgpio 17 0x2008>;
		    ite,wakeup;
            };
	};
