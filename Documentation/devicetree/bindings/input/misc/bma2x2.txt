BOSCH bma2x2 3-axis accelerometer sensor driver.

Required properties:

 - compatible		: Should be "bosch,bma2x2".
 - reg			: i2c slave address of the device.
 - pinctrl-names	: Pinctrl configuration names of this sensor driver.
				Should be "default".
 - pinctrl-0		: The pinctrl node corresponding to "default",
				should be <&bma2x2_int1_default &bma2x2_int2_default>.
 - interrupt-parent	: Parent of interrupt.
 - interrupts		: Accelerometer interrupts to indicate new data ready or events.
 - vdd-supply		: Analog power supply needed to power device.
 - vio-supply		: Digital IO power supply needed for IO and I2C.
 - bosch,init-interval	: Initial data polling interval in millisecond.
 - bosch,place		: The placing of the accelerometer on board. There are 8
				patterns of placing described as below:
				0: 1st pin is right down
				1: 1st pin is left down
				2: 1st pin is left top
				3: 1st pin is right top
				4: 1st pin is left down (from top view)
				5: 1st pin is left top (from top view)
				6: 1st pin is right top (from top view)
				7: 1st pin is right down (from top view)

Optional properties:

 - bosch,gpio-int1	: 1st irq gpio which is to provide interrupts
				to host, interrupt events can be route to any of
				these two irq pins according device configuration.
 - bosch,gpio-int2	: 2nd irq gpio which is to provide interrupts
				to host.

Example:
&i2c_0 { /* BLSP1 QUP2 */
	 bosch@18 { /* Accelerometer sensor */
		compatible = "bosch,bma2x2";
		reg = <0x18>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&bma2x2_int1_default &bma2x2_int2_default>;
		interrupt-parent = <&msm_gpio>;
		interrupts = <112 0x2002>;
		vdd-supply = <&pm8916_l17>;
		vio-supply = <&pm8916_l6>;
		bosch,init-interval = <200>;
		bosch,place = <1>;
		bosch,gpio-int1 = <&msm_gpio 112 0x2002>;
		bosch,gpio-int2 = <&msm_gpio 114 0x2002>;
	};
