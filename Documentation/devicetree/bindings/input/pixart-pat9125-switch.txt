PixArt pat9125 rotating switch

The Pixart's PAT9125 controller is connected to the host processor via I2C.
It detects the rotation when user rotates the switch and generates interrupt
to the Host processor. The host processor reads the direction and number of
steps over I2C and passes the data to the rest of the system.

Required properties:
 - compatible	: should be "pixart,pat9125".
 - reg	: i2c slave address of the device.
 - interrupt-parent	: parent of interrupt.
 - interrupts	: interrupt to indicate motion of the rotating switch.

Optional properties:
 - pixart,inverse-x 	: boolean, use this to invert the x data before sending it to input framework
 - pixart,inverse-y 	: boolean, use this to invert the y data before sending it to input framework
 - pixart,press-enabled : boolean, use this to enable detection of pressing the button

Required properties if 'pixart,press-enabled' DT property is defined:
 - pixart,press-keycode	: keycode to be sent when press is detected by the driver.

Example:
	pixart_pat9125@75 {
		compatible = "pixart,pat9125";
		reg = <0x75>;
		interrupt-parent = <&msm_gpio>;
		interrupts = <98 0x2008>;
		pixart,irq-gpio = <&msm_gpio 98 0x2008>;
	};
