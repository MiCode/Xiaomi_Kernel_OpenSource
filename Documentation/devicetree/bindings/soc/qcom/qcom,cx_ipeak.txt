* Cx iPeak driver to handle requests from various multimedia clients.

Cx ipeak HW module is used to limit the current drawn by various subsystem
blocks on Cx power rail. Each client needs to set their
bit in tcsr register if it is going to cross its own threshold. If all
clients are going to cross their thresholds then Cx ipeak hw module will raise
an interrupt to cDSP block to throttle cDSP's fmax.

Required properties:

- compatible : name of the component used for driver matching, should be
	       "qcom,cx-ipeak-sdm660"

- reg : physical base address and length of the register set(s), SRAM and XPU
	of the component.

Example:

	cx_ipeak_lm: cx_ipeak@1fe5040 {
		compatible = "qcom,cx-ipeak-sdm660";
		reg = <0x01fe5040 0x28>;
	};
