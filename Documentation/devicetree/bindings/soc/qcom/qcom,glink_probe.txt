Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. GLINK Probe

This binding describes the GLINK Probe driver, a device
that initializes the GLINK edge pairs within the system.

- compatible :
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,glink"

= SUBNODES
The GLINK probe node must contain subnodes that describes the
edge-pairs. See qcom,glink.txt for details on how to describe them.

In addition to the properties in qcom,glink.txt, The GLINK Probe driver
requires the remote-pid and transport type to be specified in the subnodes.

- transport :
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "smem", "mbox", or "spi"

- qcom,remote-pid :
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: specifies the identifier of the remote proc of this edge.

= EXAMPLE
qcom,glink {
	compatible = "qcom,glink";
	modem {
		transport = "smem";
		qcom,remote-pid = <1>;
		mboxes = <&apcs_glb 8>;
		mbox-names = "mpss_smem";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 449 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
	};
};
