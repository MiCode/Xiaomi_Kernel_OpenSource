* HAB

HAB(Hypervisor ABstraction) is meant to be a cross-platform abstraction layer
for utilizing the underlying hypervisor system. This API can be accessed from
both user and kernel sides.
The intended users of this are primarily the multimedia drivers who want to
communicate with the host OS to use the multimedia hardware.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "qcom,hab"
- vmid: the local VM's ID
  It should be unique in a system, and host's ID should be 0. Here is an
  example for a system as qvm host + agl gvm + android gvm, and such below
  setting is proper,
    qvm host's vmid: 0
    agl gvm's vmid: 1
    android gvm's vmid: 2
- mmid group properties:
  - grp-start-id: mmid group starting ID, eg, 100 is for MM_AUD_1~4
  - role: the local role of this group, and must be "fe" or "be"
  - remote-vmids: When the local role is "fe", this is to tell which VM is the
    relevant BE. When it is "be", this is to tell which VMs it will support as
    BE.

Example:
	qcom,hab {
		compatible = "qcom,hab";
		vmid = <2>;

		mmid100: mmid-grp@100 {
			grp-start-id = <100>;
			role = "fe";
			remote-vmids = <0>;
		};

		mmid200: mmid-grp@200 {
			grp-start-id = <200>;
			role = "fe";
			remote-vmids = <0>;
		};
	}
