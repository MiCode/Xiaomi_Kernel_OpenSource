BG-Daemon : When Modem goes down, to re-establish the connections,
BG-Daemon toggles the bg-reset gpio to reset BG.

- qcom,bg-reset-gpio : gpio for the apps processor use to soft reset BG
- ssr-reg1-supply : Power supply needed to power up the BG device.
                When BG brought up this regulator will be in normal power mode.
- ssr-reg2-supply : Power supply needed to power up the BG device.
                When BG BG brought up this regulator will be in normal power mode.

	qcom,bg-daemon {
		compatible = "qcom,bg-daemon";
		qcom,bg-reset-gpio = <&pm660_gpios 5 0>;
		ssr-reg1-supply = <&pm660_l3>;
		ssr-reg2-supply = <&pm660_l9>;
