MediaTek DVFSRC

The Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling Resource Collector (DVFSRC) is a
HW module which is used to collect all the requests from both software and
hardware and turn into the decision of minimum operating voltage and minimum
DRAM frequency to fulfill those requests.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following
	- "mediatek,mt8183-dvfsrc": For MT8183 SoC
	- "mediatek,mt6779-dvfsrc": For MT6779 SoC
- reg: Address range of the DVFSRC unit
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
	"dvfsrc": DVFSRC module clock
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- #interconnect-cells : should contain 1
- interconnect : interconnect providers support dram bandwidth requirements.
	The provider is able to communicate with the DVFSRC and send the dram
	bandwidth to it. shall contain only one of the following:
	"mediatek,dvfsrc-mt8183-emi"
	"mediatek,dvfsrc-mt6779-emi"

Example:

	dvfsrc@10012000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8183-dvfsrc";
		reg = <0 0x10012000 0 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&infracfg CLK_INFRA_DVFSRC>;
		clock-names = "dvfsrc";
		ddr_emi: interconnect {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt8183-emi";
			#interconnect-cells = <1>;
		};
	};
