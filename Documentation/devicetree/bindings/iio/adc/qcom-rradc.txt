Qualcomm Technologies Inc., PMIC Round Robin ADC (RRADC)

PMIC RRADC provides an interface to the clients to read
the voltage, current and temperature for supported channels
such as battery ID, battery thermistor, die temperature,
charger temperature, USB_IN and DC_IN voltage and current.

Main node properties:

- compatible:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <string>
    Definition: Should contain "qcom,rradc".

- reg:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
    Definition: RRADC base address and length in the PMIC register map.

- #address-cells:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <u32>
    Definition: Must be one. Child node 'channel' property should define ADC
            channel number. For details about IIO bindings see:
            Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/iio-bindings.txt

- #size-cells:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <u32>
    Definition: Must be zero. For details about IIO bindings see:
            Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/iio-bindings.txt

- #io-channel-cells:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <u32>
    Definition: Must be one. For details about IIO bindings see:
            Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/iio-bindings.txt

Channel subnode properties:

- channel:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <u32>
    Definition: ADC channel number.
            See drivers/iio/adc/qcom-rradc.c for channels within rradc_channel_id

Example:

	/* RRADC node */
	pmic_rradc: rradc@4500 {
		compatible = "qcom,rradc";
		reg = <0x4500 0x100>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		#io-channel-cells = <1>;

		/* Channel node */
		batt_id {
			channel = <0>;
		};
	};

	/* IIO client node */
	charger {
		io-channels = <&pmic_rradc 0>;
		io-channel-names = "rradc_batt_id";
	};
