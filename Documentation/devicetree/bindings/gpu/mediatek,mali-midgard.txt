* ARM Mali Midgard devices


Required properties:

- compatible : Should be mali<chip>, replacing digits with x from the back,
until malit<Major>xx, ending with arm,mali-midgard, the latter not optional.
- reg : Physical base address of the device and length of the register area.
- interrupts : Contains the three IRQ lines required by T-6xx devices
- interrupt-names : Contains the names of IRQ resources in the order they were
provided in the interrupts property. Must contain: "JOB, "MMU", "GPU".

Optional:

- clocks : Phandle to clock for the Mali T-6xx device.
- clock-names : Shall be "clk_mali".

Example for a Mali-T602:

gpu@0xfc010000 {
	compatible = "arm,malit602", "arm,malit60x", "arm,malit6xx", "arm,mali-midgard";
	reg = <0xfc010000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <0 36 4>, <0 37 4>, <0 38 4>;
	interrupt-names = "JOB", "MMU", "GPU";

	clocks = <&pclk_mali>;
	clock-names = "clk_mali";
};
