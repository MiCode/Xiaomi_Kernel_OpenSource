* LPM Workarounds

The required properties are:

- compatible: "qcom,lpm-workarounds"

The optional properties are:
- reg: The physical address and the size of the l1_l2_gcc and l2_pwr_sts
	regitsters of performance cluster.

- reg-names: "l2_pwr_sts" - string to identify l2_pwr_sts physical address.
	     "l1_l2_gcc" - string to identify l1_l2_gcc physical address.

- qcom,lpm-wa-cx-turbo-unvote: Indicates the workaround to unvote CX turbo
	vote when system is coming out of rpm assisted power collaspe.
	lpm-cx-supply is required if this is present.

- lpm-cx-supply:  will hold handle for CX regulator supply which is used
	to unvote.

- qcom,lpm-wa-skip-l2-spm: Due to a hardware bug on 8939 and 8909, secure
	world needs to disable and enable L2 SPM to get the proper context
	in secure watchdog bite cases. With this workaround there is a race
	in programming L2 SPM between HLOS and secure world. This leads to
	stability issues. To avoid this program L2 SPM only in secure world
	based on the L2 mode flag passed. Set lpm-wa-skip-l2-spm node if this
	is required.

- qcom,lpm-wa-dynamic-clock-gating: Due to a hardware bug on 8952, L1/L2 dynamic
	clock gating needs to be enabled by software for performance cluster
	cores and L2. Set lpm-wa-dynamic-clock-gating node if this workaround is
	required.

- qcom,cpu-offline-mask: Dynamic clock gating should be enabled when cluster is
	in L2 PC. Each bit of cpu-offline-mask lists the cpu no. to hotplug by KTM
	driver.

- qcom,non-boot-cpu-index: will hold index of non boot cluster cpu.

Example:

qcom,lpm-workarounds {
	compatible = "qcom,lpm-workarounds";
	reg = <0x0B011018 0x4>,
	      <0x0B011088 0x4>;
	reg-names = "l2-pwr-sts", "l1-l2-gcc";
	lpm-cx-supply = <&pm8916_s2_corner>;
	qcom,lpm-wa-cx-turbo-unvote;
	qcom,lpm-wa-skip-l2-spm;
	qcom,lpm-wa-dynamic-clock-gating;
	qcom,cpu-offline-mask = "0xF";
	qcom,non-boot-cpu-index = <4>;
}
