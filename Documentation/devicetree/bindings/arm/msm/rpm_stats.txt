* RPM Stats

RPM maintains a counter of the number of times the SoC entered a deeper sleep
mode involving lowering or powering down the backbone rails - Cx and Mx and
the oscillator clock, XO.

PROPERTIES

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Should be "qcom,rpm-stats".

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: The address on the RPM RAM from where the stats are read
	            should be provided as "phys_addr_base". The offset from
	            which the stats are available should be provided as
	            "offset_addr".

- reg-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Provides labels for the reg property.

EXAMPLE:

	qcom,rpm-stats@c000000 {
		compatible = "qcom,rpm-stats";
		reg = <0xC000000 0x1000>, <0x3F0000 0x4>;
		reg-names = "phys_addr_base", "offset_addr";
	};
