MSM thermal driver (MSM_THERMAL)

MSM_THERMAL is a kernel platform driver which regulates thermal conditions
on the device during kernel boot. The goal of MSM_THERMAL is to prevent the
temperature of the system from exceeding a thermal limit at which it cannot
operate. Examples are CPU junction thermal limit, or POP memory thermal limit.
The MSM_THERMAL driver polls the TSENS sensor hardware during boot, and
reduces the maximum CPU frequency allowed in steps, to limit power/thermal
output when a threshold temperature is crossed. It restores the maximum CPU
frequency allowed in the same stepwise fashion when the threshold temperature
(with hysteresis gap) is cleared.

The devicetree representation of the MSM_THERMAL block should be:

Required properties

- compatible: "qcom,msm-thermal"
- qcom,sensor-id: The id of the TSENS sensor polled for temperature.
			Typically the sensor closest to CPU0.
- qcom,poll-ms: Sampling interval to read sensor, in ms.
- qcom,limit-temp: Threshold temperature to start stepping CPU down, in degC.
- qcom,temp-hysteresis: Degrees C below threshold temperature to step CPU up.
- qcom,freq-step: Number of frequency steps to take on each CPU mitigation.

Optional properties

- qcom,freq-control-mask: The cpu mask that will be used to determine if a
			core can be used for freq control.
- qcom,core-limit-temp: Threshold temperature to start shutting down cores
			in degC
- qcom,core-temp-hysteresis: Degrees C below which the cores will be brought
			online in sequence.
- qcom,core-control-mask: The cpu mask that will be used to determine if a
			core can be controlled or not. A mask of 0 indicates
			the feature is disabled.
- qcom,hotplug-temp: Threshold temperature to start shutting down cores
			in degC. This will be used when polling based
			core control is disabled. The difference between hotplug-temp
			and core-limit-temp is that core-limit-temp is used during
			early boot prior to thermal_sys being available for hotplug.
- qcom,hotplug-temp-hysteresis: Degrees C below which thermal will not force the
			cores to be offlined. Cores can be brought online if needed.
- qcpm,cpu-sensors:     List of type names in thermal zone device struct which maps
			to cpu0, cpu1, cpu2, cpu3 in sequence depending on how many
			cpus there are.
- qcom,freq-mitigation-temp: Threshold temperature to mitigate
			the CPU max frequency in degC. This will be
			used when polling based frequency control is disabled.
			The difference between freq-mitigation-temp
			and limit-temp is that limit-temp is used during
			early boot prior to thermal_sys being available for registering
			temperature thresholds. Also, this emergency frequency
			mitigation is a single step frequency mitigation to a predefined value
			as opposed to the step by step frequency mitigation during boot-up.
- qcom,freq-mitigation-temp-hysteresis: Degrees C below which thermal will not mitigate the
			cpu max frequency.
- qcom,freq-mitigation-value: The frequency value (in kHz) to which the thermal
			should mitigate the CPU, when the freq-mitigation-temp
			threshold is reached.
- qcom,freq-mitigation-control-mask: The frequency mitigation bitmask that will be
			used to determine if KTM should do emergency frequency
			mitigation for a core or not. A mask of 0x00 indicates the
			mitigation is disabled for all the cores and a mask of 0x05
			indicates this mitigation is enabled for cpu-0 and cpu-2.
			Note: For KTM's frequency mitigation to work, the data for all the
			above four properties (qcom,freq-mitigation-temp; qcom,
			freq-mitigation-temp-hysteresis; qcom,freq-mitigation-value and
			qcom,freq-mitigation-control-mask) should be populated.
- qcom,vdd-restriction-temp: When temperature is below this threshold, will
			enable vdd restriction which will set higher voltage on
			key voltage rails, in degC.
- qcom,vdd-restriction-temp-hysteresis: When temperature is above this threshold
			will disable vdd restriction on key rails, in degC.
- qcom,pmic-sw-mode-temp: Threshold temperature to disable auto mode on the
			rail, in degC. If this property exists,
			qcom,pmic-sw-mode-temp-hysteresis and
			qcom,pmic-sw-mode-regs need to exist, otherwise return error.
- qcom,pmic-sw-mode-temp-hysteresis: Degree below threshold temperature to
			enable auto mode on the rail, in degC. If this property exists,
			qcom,pmic-sw-mode-temp and qcom,pmic-sw-mode-regs need to
			exist, otherwise return error.
- qcom,pmic-sw-mode-regs: Array of the regulator names that will want to
			disable/enable automode based on the threshold. If this
			property exists, qcom,pmic-sw-mode-temp and
			qcom,pmic-sw-mode-temp-hysteresis need to exist, otherwise
			return error. Also, if this property is defined, will have to
			define <consumer_supply_name>-supply = <&phandle_of_regulator>
- <consumer_supply_name>-supply = <&phandle_of_regulator>: consumer_supply_name
			is the name that's defined in thermal driver.
			phandle_of_regulator is defined by reuglator device tree.
- qcom,online-hotplug-core: This property should be defined in targets where
			KTM should online cores, which are hotplugged due to
			thermal condition.
- qcom,synchronous-cluster-id: This property specifies an array of synchronous cluster-ID's.
			This property will be used by KTM to optimize the synchronous
			cluster frequency update.
- qcom,synchronous-cluster-map: This property specifies an array of cluster-ID and its
			associated cpumask value pair. This property should be defined
			in targets where the kernel topology module is not present.
			In the older kernel version, where the kernel topology module is
			not available, KTM gets the mapping information from this property.

The sensor information node is an optional node that holds information
about thermal sensors on a target. The information includes sensor type,
sensor name, sensor alias and sensor scaling factor. The parent node
name is qcom,sensor-information. It has a list of optional child
nodes, each representing a sensor. The child node is named as
qcom,sensor-information@<id>. The id takes values sequentially
from 0 to N-1 where N is the number of sensors. This id doesn't
relate to zone id or sensor id.

The devicetree representation of sensor information node should be:

1.0 Required properties:

- compatible: "qcom,sensor-information"

1.1 Optional nodes:

qcom,sensor-information@<id>

The below properties belong to the child node qcom,sensor-information@<id>.
Following are the required and optional properties of a child node.

1.1.a Required properties:

- qcom,sensor-type: Type of a sensor. A sensor can be of type tsens,
			alarm or adc.
			tsens: 	Sensors that are on MSM die.
			alarm: 	Sensors that are on PMIC die.
			adc:   	Sensors that are usually thermistors
				placed out of the die.
- qcom,sensor-name: Name of a sensor as defined by low level sensor driver.

1.1.b Optional properties:

			sensor temperature to get temperature unit in
			degree centigrade. If this property is not
