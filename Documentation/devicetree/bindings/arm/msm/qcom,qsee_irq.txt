Binding for the QTI Secure Execution Environment IRQ controller
===============================================================

The QTI Secure Execution Environment (QSEE) IRQ controller facilitates receiving
and clearing interrupts from QSEE. Each interrupt from QSEE has a set of control
registers to mask, clear and get the status of interrupts. This controller will
create an interrupt for clients to register with based on the bits available in
the control registers.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,sm8150-qsee-irq"

- syscon:
	usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: phandle to a syscon node representing the scsr registers

- interrupts:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded array>
	Definition: multiple entries specifying the interrupts from QSEE

- interrupt-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Interrupt names should be one of the following to map the
		    interrupt back to the correct registers.
		    - sp_ipc%d
		    - sp_rmb

- interrupt-controller:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <empty>
	Definition: Identifies this node as an interrupt controller

- #interrupt-cells
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 3 - for interrupts to encode these properties:
		    - u32 denoting index of desired interrupt in @interrupts
		    - u32 denoting bit of interrupt bank
		    - u32 denoting IRQ flags

= EXAMPLE
The following example shows the QSEE_IRQ setup with the GLINK SPSS node, defined
from the sm8150 apps processor's point-of-view. In this example the GLINK node
registers for the sp_ipc0 interrupt(index 0 in interrupt-names) and the 0th
bit on the sp_ipc0 interrupt bank.

sp_scsr_block: syscon@1880000 {
	compatible = “syscon”;
	reg = <0x1880000 0x10000>;
};

intsp: qcom,qsee_irq {
	compatible = "qcom,sm8150-qsee-irq";

	syscon = <&sp_scsr_block>;
	interrupts = <0 348 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <0 349 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

	interrupt-names = "sp_ipc0",
			  "sp_ipc1";

	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <3>;
};

spss {
	...
	glink {
		qcom,remote-pid = <8>;
		mboxes = <&sp_scsr 0>;
		mbox-names = "spss_spss";
		interrupts = <&intsp 0 0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
	};
};
