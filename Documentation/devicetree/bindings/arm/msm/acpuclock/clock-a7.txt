* Qualcomm Application CPU clock driver

clock-a7 is the driver for the Root Clock Generator (rcg) hw which controls
the cpu rate. RCGs support selecting one of several clock inputs, as well as
a configurable divider. This hw is different than normal rcgs in that it may
optionally have a register which encodes the maximum rate supported by hw.

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,clock-a7-8226", "qcom,clock-a7-9630",
		"qcom,clock-a53-8916", "qcom,clock-a7-vpipa",
		"qcom,clock-a7-9640", "qcom,clock-a7-californium"
		"qcom,clock-a7-9640", "qcom,clock-a7-mdm9607"
- reg: pairs of physical address and region size
- reg-names: "rcg-base" is expected
- clock-names: list of names of clock inputs
- qcom,speedX-bin-vZ:
		A table of CPU frequency (Hz) to regulator voltage (uV) mapping.
		Format: <freq uV>
		This represents the max frequency possible for each possible
		power configuration for a CPU that's binned as speed bin X,
		speed bin revision Z. Speed bin values can be between [0-7]
		and the version can be between [0-3].

- cpu-vdd-supply: regulator phandle for cpu power domain.

Optional properties:
- reg-names: "efuse", "efuse1"
- qcom,safe-freq: Frequency in HZ
	     When switching rates from A to B, the mux div clock will
             instead switch from A -> safe_freq -> B.
- qcom,enable-opp: This will allow to register the cpu clock with OPP
	     framework.

Example:
	qcom,acpuclk@f9011050 {
                compatible = "qcom,clock-a7-8226";
                reg = <0xf9011050 0x8>;
                reg-names = "rcg_base";
                cpu-vdd-supply = <&apc_vreg_corner>;

                clock-names = "clk-4", "clk-5";
		qcom,speed0-bin-v0 =
			<384000000 1150000>,
			<600000000 1200000>;
        };
