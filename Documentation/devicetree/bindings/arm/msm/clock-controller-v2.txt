QTI MSM Clock controller

QTI MSM Clock controller devices contain subnodes describing PLLs, root
clock generators and other clock hardware blocks that provide stable, low
power clock signals to a QTI SOC.

Required Properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,msm-clock-controller"
- reg:			Pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes of
			memory mapped registers.
- reg-names:		"cc-base" is expected.

Optional Properties:
- <regulator_name>-supply:
			A regulator phandle. Multiple such properties may exist.

- qcom,regulator-names: A list of regulator_name for iterating through all
			<regulator_name>-supply properties.

Example:

clock-gcc: gcc-cc {
	compatible = "qcom,msm-clock-controller";
	reg = <0xfc400000 0x4000>;
	reg-names = "cc-base";
	#clock-cells = <1>;

	gcc-vdd-dig-supply = <&pma8084_s2_corner>;
	qcom,regulator-names = "gcc-vdd-dig";

	GCC-vdd-dig: gcc-vdd-dig {
		compatible = "qcom,simple-vdd-class";
		qcom,regulators = <&pma8084_s2_corner>;
		qcom,levels =
				<RPM_REGULATOR_CORNER_NONE>,
				<RPM_REGULATOR_CORNER_SVS_SOC>,
				<RPM_REGULATOR_CORNER_NOMINAL>,
				<RPM_REGULATOR_CORNER_SUPER_TURBO>;
	};

	xo: xo {

		qcom,res-id = <0>;
		qcom,key = "Enable";
		qcom,rpm-peer = <&xo>;
		qcom,rate = <19200000>;
	};

	gpll0: gpll0 {
		compatible = "qcom,alpha-pll-20p";
		qcom,base-offset = <GCC_APCS_GPLL_ENA_VOTE>;
		qcom,config-rate = <600000000>;
	};

	usb30_master_clk_src {
		qcom,freq-tbl =
			<  19200000    1    0    0    0  &xo>,
			< 125000000    1    0    5    24 &gpll0>;
	};

	usb30_master_clk_src: usb30_master_clk_src {
		compatible = "qcom,rcg-mn";
		qcom,base-offset = <GCC_USB30_MASTER_CMD_RCGR>;
		qcom,parents =
			<    0 &xo>,
			<    1 &gpll0>;

		qcom,supply-group = <&GCC_vdd_dig>;
		qcom,clk-fmax =
			<FMAX_LOW 100000000>,
			<FMAX_NOM 125000000>,
			<FMAX_TURBO 125000000>;
	};
};

"qcom,simple-vdd-class"

On QTI MSMs, voting for device frequency/voltage requirements is done by
the clock driver. This subnode describes a set of regulator configurations.

Required Properties:
- compatible		Must be "qcom,simple-vdd-class"

- qcom,regulators:	List of regulator_phandle.
			The regulators for which these perfomance levels will be
			applied to. The regulators must have corresponding
			<regulator_name>-supply and qcom,regulator-names
			properties in the parent qcom,msm-clock-controller node.

- qcom,uV-levels:	2d array of voltage(uV) values.

Optional Properties:
- qcom,uA-levels:	2d array of current(uA) values.
			If this property is present, it must have the same length
			as the qcom,uV-levels array.

GCC-vdd-dig: gcc-vdd-dig {
	compatible = "qcom,simple-vdd-class";
	qcom,regulators = <&pma8084_s2_corner &pma8082_s3>;
	qcom,uV-levels =
		/*pma 8084_s2_corner*/		/*pma8082_s3*/
		<LOWEST_VOLTAGE_LEVEL		LOW>,
		<MED_VOLTAGE_LEVEL		MED>,
		<HIGH_VOLTAGE_LEVEL		HIGH>;
	qcom,uA-levels =
		<LOWEST_CURRENT_LEVEL		LOW>,
		<MED_CURRENT_LEVEL		MED>,
		<HIGH_CURRENT_LEVEL		HIGH>;
};

*****************************************************************************
General Optional Properties available to any Clock Subnode

- qcom,clk-flags:	Refer to include/linux/clk/msm-clock.h

- qcom,parent:		Phandle.
			This property is used by clocks with a single parent.
			Clocks with multiple parents may not use this property.

- qcom,supply-group:	Phandle.
			Reference to a vdd_class subnode.

- qcom,clk-fmax:	List of <vdd_class_performance_level  maximum_frequency>.
			If this property is defined, qcom,supply-group must
			also be defined and vice-versa.
			When a clock changes frequency, the MSM clock framework
			will look through this table to find the minimum supply
			group level required.

- qcom,depends:		Phandle.
			Some clocks may require other clocks other than their parent
			clocks to be turned on to operate properly.

- qcom,config-rate:	Integer.
			Configure a clock to a specific rate(Hz) at boot.

- qcom,always-on:	Boolean.
			Enable a clock at boot, and leave it on all the time.
			Requires qcom,config-rate to be set.
