* MSM Sleep Power Manager (mpm-v2)

The MPM acts a sleep power manager to shutdown the clock source and put the
device into a retention mode to save power. The MPM is also responsible for
waking up and bringing up the resources from sleep. The MPM driver configures
interrupts monitored by the MPM hardware before entering sleep through a
RPM interface.

The required nodes for the MPM driver are:

- compatible: "qcom, mpm-v2"
- reg: Specifies the base physical address(s) and the size of the MPM
	registers. The MPM driver access two memory regions for confifure the
	virtual MPM driver on the RPM. The first region is the memory space
	shared with the virtual MPM driver. The second region is the address
	to the register that triggers a interrupt to the RPM.
- reg-names: "vmpm" - string to identify the shared memory space region
	     "ipc" - string to identify the register that triggers a interrupt
- clocks: clock identifers used by clock driver while looking up mpm clocks.
- clock-names: name of the clock used by mpm driver.
- qcom,ipc-bit-offset: The bit to set in the ipc register that triggers a interrupt
	to the RPM
- qcom,gic-parent: phandle to the gic interrupt controller
- qcom,gic-map: Provides a mapping of how a GIC interrupt is connect to a MPM. The
	mapping is presented in tuples. Each tuple represents a MPM pin and
	which GIC interrupt is routed to it. Since MPM monitors interrupts
	only during system wide low power mode, system interrupts originating
	from other processors can be ignored and assigned an MPM pin mapping
	of 0xff.
- qcom,gpio-parent: phandle to the GPIO interrupt controller
- qcom,gpio-map: Provides a mapping of how a GPIO interrupt is connect to a MPM. The
	mapping is presented in tuples. Each tuple represents a MPM pin and
	which GIC interrupt is routed to it. Since MPM monitors interrupts
	only during system wide low power mode, system interrupts originating
	from other processors can be ignored and assigned an MPM pin mapping
	of 0xff.

Example:
	qcom,mpm@fc4281d0 {
		compatible = "qcom,mpm-v2";
		reg = <0xfc4281d0 0x1000>, /* MSM_RPM_MPM_BASE 4K*/
		    <0xfa006000 0x1000>;   /* MSM_APCS_GCC_BASE 4K*/
		reg-names = "vmpm", "ipc"
			interrupts = <0 171 1>;
		clocks = <&clock_rpm clk_xo_lpm_clk>;
		clock-names = "xo";

		qcom,ipc-bit-offset = <0>;

		qcom,gic-parent = <&intc>;
		qcom,gic-map = <25 132>,

			<0xff 48>,
			<0xff 51>,
			<0xff 52>,
			<0xff 53>,
			<0xff 54>,
