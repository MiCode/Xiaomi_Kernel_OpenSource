* Low Power Management Resources

The application processor in the MSM can enter several different low power
states depending on the sleep time and on the required system resources. The
MSM cannot enter a given low power state if that state involves turning off
some shared resources which are required by some components of the
system.The lpm-resources device tree node represents the shared resources
that need to be monitored for usage requirement to check if a given low power
state can be entered.Each resource is identified by a combination of the name,
id,type and key which is also used by the RPM to identify a shared resource.
The name and resource-type are required nodes; the type, id and key are
optional nodes which are needed if the resource type is RPM shared resource
(MSM_LPM_RPM_RS_TYPE).

The nodes for lpm-resources are:

Required Nodes:

- compatible: "qcom,lpm-resources"
- reg: The numeric level id
- qcom,name: The name of the low power resource represented
             as a string.
- qcom,init-value: Initialization value of the LPM resource represented as
			decimal value for vdd-dig and vdd-mem resources and
			as string for pxo and l2 resources.


Optional Nodes:

- qcom,type: The type of resource used like smps or pxo
             represented as a hex value.
- qcom,id: The id representing a device within a resource type.
- qcom,key: The key is the specific attribute of the resource being
            monitored represented as a hex value.
- qcom,local-resource-type: The property exists only for locally managed
				resource and is represented as a bool.

Example:
            qcom,lpm-resources@0 {
                        reg = <0x0>;
                        qcom,name = "vdd-dig";
                        qcom,type = <0x62706d73>;   /* "smpb" */
                        qcom,id = <0x02>;
                        qcom,key = <0x6e726f63>;   /* "corn" */
			qcom,init-value= <5>;   /* Active Corner*/
                };
