* Low Power Management Resources

The application processor in the MSM can enter several different low power
states depending on the sleep time and on the required system resources. The
MSM cannot enter a given low power state if that state involves turning off
some shared resources which are required by some components of the
system.The lpm-resources device tree node represents the shared resources
that need to be monitored for usage requirement to check if a given low power
state can be entered.Each resource is identified by a combination of the name,
id,type and key which is also used by the RPM to identify a shared resource.

The required nodes for lpm-resources are:

- compatible: "qcom,lpm-resources"
- reg: The numeric level id
- qcom,name: The name of the low power resource.
- qcom,type: The string represeting the type of resource used
             like smps or pxo.
- qcom,id: The id representing a device within a resource type.
- qcom,key: The key is the specific attribute of the resource being
            monitored.

Example:
            qcom,lpm-resources@0 {
                        reg = <0x0>;
                        qcom,name = "vdd-dig";
                        qcom,type = "smpb\0";
                        qcom,id = <0x02>;
                        qcom,key = "uv\0\0";
                };
