ION Memory Manager (ION)

ION is a memory manager that allows for sharing of buffers between different
processes and between user space and kernel space. ION manages different
memory spaces by separating the memory spaces into "heaps". Depending on the
type of heap ION must reserve memory using the msm specific memory reservation
bindings (see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/memory-reserve.txt).

Required properties for Ion

- compatible: "qcom,msm-ion"


All child nodes of a qcom,msm-ion node are interpreted as Ion heap
configurations.

Required properties for Ion heaps

- reg: The ID of the ION heap.
- qcom,ion-heap-type: The heap type to use for this heap. Should be one of
  the following:
    - "SYSTEM"
    - "SYSTEM_CONTIG"
    - "CARVEOUT"
    - "SECURE_CARVEOUT"
    - "CHUNK"
    - "CP"
    - "DMA"
    - "SECURE_DMA"

Optional properties for Ion heaps

- compatible: "qcom,msm-ion-reserve" This is required if memory is to be reserved
  as specified by qcom,memory-reservation-size below.
- qcom,heap-align: Alignment of start of the memory in the heap.
- qcom,heap-adjacent: ID of heap this heap needs to be adjacent to.
- qcom,memory-reservation-size: size of reserved memory for the ION heap.
- qcom,memory-reservation-type: type of memory to be reserved
(see memory-reserve.txt for information about memory reservations)
- qcom,default-prefetch-size: Base value to be used for prefetching
  optimizations. Ignored if the heap does not support prefetching.
  Will set to a reasonable default value (e.g. the maximum heap size)
  if this option is not set.


Example:
	qcom,ion {
                 compatible = "qcom,msm-ion";
                 #address-cells = <1>;
                 #size-cells = <0>;

                 qcom,ion-heap@25 {
                         reg = <25>;
                         qcom,ion-heap-type = "SYSTEM";
                 };

                 qcom,ion-heap@8 { /* CP_MM HEAP */
                         compatible = "qcom,msm-ion-reserve";
                         reg = <8>;
                         qcom,heap-align = <0x1000>;
                         linux,contiguous-region = <&secure_mem>;
                         qcom,ion-heap-type = "SECURE_DMA";
                 };

                 qcom,ion-heap@29 { /* FIRMWARE HEAP */
                         compatible = "qcom,msm-ion-reserve";
                         reg = <29>;
                         qcom,heap-align = <0x20000>;
                         qcom,heap-adjacent = <8>;
                         qcom,memory-reservation-type = "EBI1"; /* reserve EBI memory */
                         qcom,memory-reservation-size = <0xA00000>;
                         qcom,ion-heap-type = "CARVEOUT";
                 };
	};

"SECURE_CARVEOUT"

This heap type is expected to contain multiple child nodes. Each child node
shall contain the following required properties:

- memory-regions:
Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt

- token:
A u32 containing the set of secure domains which will be able to access the
memory-region.

Example:
qcom,ion {
	compatible = "qcom,msm-ion";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	qcom,ion-heap@14 {
		reg = <14>;
		qcom,ion-heap-type = "SECURE_CARVEOUT";

		node1 {
			memory-regions = <&cp_region>;
			token = <ION_FLAG_CP_TOUCH>;
		};
	};
};
