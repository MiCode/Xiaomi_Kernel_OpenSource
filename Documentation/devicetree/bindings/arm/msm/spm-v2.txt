* MSM Subsystem Power Manager (spm-v2)

S4 generation of MSMs have SPM hardware blocks to control the Application
Processor Sub-System power. These SPM blocks run individual state machine
to determine what the core (L2 or Krait/Scorpion) would do when the WFI
instruction is executed by the core. The SAW hardware block handles SPM and
AVS functionality for the cores.

The devicetree representation of the SPM block should be:

Required properties

- compatible: "qcom,spm-v2"
- reg: The physical address and the size of the SPM's memory mapped registers
- qcom, core-id: The core id the SPM block is attached to.
	{0..n} for cores {0..n}
	{0xffff} for L2
- qcom,saw2-ver-reg: The location of the version register
- qcom,saw2-cfg: SAW2 configuration register
- qcom,saw2-avs-ctl: The AVS control register
- qcom,saw2-avs-hysterisis: The AVS hysterisis register to delay the AVS
	controller requests
- qcom,saw2-spm-dly: Provides the values for the SPM delay command in the SPM
	sequence
- qcom,saw2-spm-ctl: The SPM control register
- qcom,saw2-vctl-timeout-us: The timeout value to wait for voltage to change
	after sending the voltage command to the PMIC

Optional properties

- qcom,saw2-avs-limit: The AVS limit register
- qcom,saw2-avs-dly: The AVS delay register is used to specify the delay values
	between AVS controller requests
- qcom,saw2-pmic-dly: The delay values for waiting on PMIC response
- qcom,saw2-pmic-data0..7: Specify the pmic data value and the associated FTS
	index to send the PMIC data to
- qcom,saw2-vctl-port: The FTS port used for changing voltage
- qcom,saw2-phase-port: The FTS port used for changing the number of phases
- qcom,saw2-spm-cmd-wfi: The WFI command sequence
- qcom,saw2-spm-cmd-ret: The Retention command sequence
- qcom,saw2-spm-cmd-spc: The Standalone PC command sequence
- qcom,saw2-spm-cmd-pc: The Power Collapse command sequence
- qcom,saw2-spm-cmd-gdhs: L2 GDHS command sequence
