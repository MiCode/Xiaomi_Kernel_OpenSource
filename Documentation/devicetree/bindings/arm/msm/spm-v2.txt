* MSM Subsystem Power Manager (spm-v2)

S4 generation of MSMs have SPM hardware blocks to control the Application
Processor Sub-System power. These SPM blocks run individual state machine
to determine what the core (L2 or Krait/Scorpion) would do when the WFI
instruction is executed by the core. The SAW hardware block handles SPM and
AVS functionality for the cores.

The devicetree representation of the SPM block should be:

Required properties

- compatible: "qcom,spm-v2"
- reg: The physical address and the size of the SPM's memory mapped registers
- qcom,cpu: phandle for the CPU that the SPM block is attached to.  This field
is required on only for SPMs that control the CPU. This field is not required
for SPMs that control L2/CCI/L3
- qcom,saw2-ver-reg: The location of the version register
- qcom,name: The name with which a SPM device is identified by the power
management code.

----------------------------------------------------
Non-PSCI targets should follow the rules shown below
----------------------------------------------------
Required properties for only Non-PSCI targets:

- qcom,saw2-cfg: SAW2 configuration register
- qcom,saw2-spm-ctl: The SPM control register
- qcom,saw2-spm-dly: Provides the values for the SPM delay command in the SPM
	sequence

Optional properties for only Non-PSCI targets
- reg-names: Register names for the physical address required if spm device
        has more than one physical addressed to be mapped. Allowed register
        names are: "saw-base", "q2s", "hw-flush", "slpreq"
- qcom,saw2-avs-ctl: The AVS control register
- qcom,saw2-avs-hysterisis: The AVS hysterisis register to delay the AVS
	controller requests
- qcom,vctl-timeout-us: The timeout value in us to wait for voltage to change
	after sending the voltage command to the PMIC
- qcom,saw2-avs-limit: The AVS limit register
- qcom,saw2-avs-dly: The AVS delay register is used to specify the delay values
	between AVS controller requests
- qcom,saw2-pmic-data0..7: Specify the pmic data value and the associated FTS
	index to send the PMIC data to
- qcom,vctl-port: The PVC (PMIC Virtual Channel) port used for changing
	voltage
- qcom,vctl-port-ub: The PVC (PMIC Virtual Channel) port used for changing
	voltage
- qcom,phase-port: The PVC port used for changing the number of phases
- qcom,pfm-port: The PVC port used for enabling PWM/PFM modes
- qcom,cpu-vctl-mask: Mask of cpus, whose voltage the spm device can control.
	Depricated: Replaced with cpu-vctl-list when cpu phandles are available.
- qcom,cpu-vctl-list: List of cpu node phandles, whose voltage the spm device
	can control.
- qcom,use-qchannel-for-pc: Boolean property to specify if qchannel should be
	ignored when entering power collapse. If this property is set qchannel
	will not be ignored in power collapse.
- qcom,supports-rpm-hs: Indicates that this SPM instance allow handshake with
RPM processor when executing the sleep command in the SPM sequence. Supported
only on SAW2 v3.0 and above.
- qcom,use-spm-clock-gating: This boolean property is used to indicate that
	the SPM needs to be used for clock gating. Using the SPM for clock
	gating would result in auto clock gating being disabled. Use this on
	targets that do not support or do not use auto clock gating.
- qcom,use-qchannel-for-wfi: This boolean property is used to indicate
	that the SPM gets triggerd by the qchannel and not by means of
	wfi. So a wfe could trigger a spm for clock gating as well.
- qcom,pwr-state-dx: Indicates the power state idx of the core.
- qcom,wake-config: Indicate SPM wake up signal configuration.
- modes: Lists all the available low power modes for the device

Second level properties for modes

Required properties (if modes node is available)
- qcom,label: Specifies the mode name such as:
            qcom,saw2-spm-cmd-wfi: WFI mode
            qcom,saw2-spm-cmd-ret: Retention mode
            qcom,saw2-spm-cmd-spc: Standalone PC mode
            qcom,saw2-spm-cmd-pc: Power Collapse mode
            qcom,saw2-spm-cmd-gdhs: GDHS mode
- qcom,sequence: Specifies sequence for the low power mode
Optional properties
- qcom,pc_mode: Specifies pc_mode bit should be set in the SPM control register
- qcom,ret_mode: Specifies ret_mode bit should be set in the SPM control register
- qcom,spm_en: Specifies spm_en bit should be set in the SPM control register
- qcom,isar: Specifies isar bit should be set in the SPM control register
	Specify this property only if SPM should retain its start address at
	the end of the program.
- qcom,slp_cmd_mode: Specifies slp_cmd_mode bit should be set in SPM control register.
	Adding this property results in SPM handshaking with RPM. Please remove
	the RPM handshake command from the sleep sequence, replace that with
	Sleep without RPM handshake command.
- qcom,event_sync: Specifies event_sync byte should be set in SPM control
	register.

----------------------------------------------------
PSCI targets should follow the rules shown below
----------------------------------------------------
Optional properties for only PSCI targets:

- qcom,saw2-avs-ctl: The AVS control register
- qcom,saw2-avs-hysterisis: The AVS hysterisis register to delay the AVS
	controller requests
- qcom,vctl-timeout-us: The timeout value in us to wait for voltage to change
	after sending the voltage command to the PMIC
- qcom,saw2-avs-limit: The AVS limit register
- qcom,saw2-avs-dly: The AVS delay register is used to specify the delay values
	between AVS controller requests
