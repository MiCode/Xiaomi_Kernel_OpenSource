* JTAG-MM

The jtag-mm entry specifies the memory mapped addresses for the debug and ETM
registers. The jtag-mm driver uses these to save and restore the registers
using memory mapped access during power collapse so as to retain their state
accross power collapse. This is necessary in case cp14 access to the registers
is not permitted.

Required Properties:
compatible: component name used for driver matching, should be:
	"qcom,jtag-mm"  - for jtag-mm device
	"qcom,jtagv8-mm" - for jtagv8-mm device supporting ARMv8 targets
reg: physical base address and length of the register set
reg-names: should be "etm-base" for etm register set and "debug-base" for debug
	register set.
qcom,coresight-jtagmm-cpu : specifies phandle for the cpu associated with the
			    jtag-mm device
qcom,si-enable : boolean, indicating etm save and restore is supported via
		 system instructions
qcom,save-restore-disable : boolean, to disable etm save and restore
			    functionality

Example:
jtag_mm: jtagmm@fc332000 {
	compatible = "qcom,jtag-mm";
	reg = <0xfc332000 0x1000>,
		<0xfc333000 0x1000>;
	reg-names = "etm-base","debug-base";

	qcom,coresight-jtagmm-cpu = <&CPU0>;
	};
