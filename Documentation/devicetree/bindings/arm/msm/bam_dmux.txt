Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. BAM Data Multiplexer Driver

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "qcom,bam_dmux"
- reg : the location and size of the BAM hardware
- interrupts : the BAM hardware to apps processor interrupt line

Optional properties:
-qcom,satellite-mode: the hardware needs to be configured in satellite mode
-qcom,rx-ring-size: the size of the receive ring buffer pool, default is 32
-qcom,max-rx-mtu: the maximum receive MTU that can be negotiated, in bytes.
	Default is 2048.  Other possible values are 4096, 8192, and 16384.
-qcom,no-cpu-affinity: boolean value indicating that workqueue CPU affinity
	is not required.
-qcom,fast-shutdown: boolean value to support fast shutdown time.

Example:

	qcom,bam_dmux@fc834000 {
		compatible = "qcom,bam_dmux";
		reg = <0xfc834000 0x7000>;
		interrupts = <0 29 1>;
		qcom,satellite-mode;
		qcom,rx-ring-size = <64>;
		qcom,max-rx-mtu = <8192>;
		qcom,no-cpu-affinity;
		qcom,fast-shutdown;
	};
