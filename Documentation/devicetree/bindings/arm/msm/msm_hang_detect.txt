* Qualcomm MSM Core Hang Detection

Core Hang Detection provides the three sysfs entries for configuring
threshold, PMU event mux select and to enable hang detection.

If core is hung for threshold time (value X 10ns) and no
heart beat event from pmu to core hang monitor detection, core hang
interrupt would be generated to reset the SOC via secure watchdog
to collect all cores context.

PMU event mux select can be programmed to one of the supported
events, for example-
1) Load Instruction executed,
2) Store Instructions executed
3) Instruction architecturally executed and etc.

Writing 1 into enable sysfs entry, enables core hang detection and
if there is no selected PMU mux event for 10ns core hang counter
gets incremented. Once counter reaches the programmed threshold value,
core hang interrupts generated to reset the SOC.


The device tree parameters for the core hang detection are:

Required properties:

- compatible : "qcom,core-hang-detect"
- label: unique name used to created sysfs entry
- qcom,threshold-arr :
	Array of APCS_ALIAS*_CORE_HANG_THRESHOLD register address
	for each core.
- qcom,config-arr :
	Array of APCS_ALIAS*_CORE_HANG_CONFIG register address
	for each core.

Optional properties:

Example:
  For msm8937:
	qcom,chd {
		compatible = "qcom,core-hang-detect";
		qcom,threshold-arr = <0xB088094 0xB098094 0xB0A8094
			0xB0B8094 0xB188094 0xB198094 0xB1A8094 0xB1B8094>;
		qcom,config-arr = <0xB08809C 0xB09809C 0xB0A809C
			0xB0B809C 0xB18809C 0xB19809C 0xB1A809C 0xB1B809C>;
	};

  For msmtitanium:
	qcom,chd {
		compatible = "qcom,core-hang-detect";
		qcom,threshold-arr = <0xB1880B0 0xB1980B0 0xB1A80B0
			0xB1B80B0 0xB0880B0 0xB0980B0 0xB0A80B0 0xB0B80B0>;
		qcom,config-arr = <0xB1880B8 0xB1980B8 0xB1A80B8
			0xB1B80B8 0xB0880B8 0xB0980B8 0xB0A80B8 0xB0B80B8>;
