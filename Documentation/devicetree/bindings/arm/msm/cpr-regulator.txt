Qualcomm CPR (Core Power Reduction) Regulator

CPR regulator device is for Qualcomm RBCPR (RapidBridge CPR) on
	application processor core. It takes voltage corner level
	as input and converts it to actual voltage based on the
	suggestions from factory production process. When CPR is
	enabled for application processer core, it will suggest
	scaling the voltage up or down for best performance and
	power of the core. The scaling based on factory production
	process is called PVS (Process Voltage Scaling) with efuse
	bits to indicate what bin (and voltage range) a chip is in.
