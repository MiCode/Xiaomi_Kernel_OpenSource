* CoreSight Components:

CoreSight components are compliant with the ARM CoreSight architecture
specification and can be connected in various topologies to suit a particular
SoCs tracing needs. These trace components can generally be classified as
sinks, links and sources. Trace data produced by one or more sources flows
through the intermediate links connecting the source to the currently selected
sink. Each CoreSight component device should use these properties to describe
its hardware characteristcs.

* Required properties for all components *except* non-configurable replicators:

	* compatible: These have to be supplemented with "arm,primecell" as
	  drivers are using the AMBA bus interface.  Possible values include:
		- Embedded Trace Buffer (version 1.0):
			"arm,coresight-etb10", "arm,primecell";

		- Trace Port Interface Unit:
			"arm,coresight-tpiu", "arm,primecell";

		- Trace Memory Controller, used for Embedded Trace Buffer(ETB),
		  Embedded Trace FIFO(ETF) and Embedded Trace Router(ETR)
		  configuration.  The configuration mode (ETB, ETF, ETR) is
		  discovered at boot time when the device is probed.
			"arm,coresight-tmc", "arm,primecell";

		- Trace Funnel:
			"arm,coresight-funnel", "arm,primecell";

		- Embedded Trace Macrocell (version 3.x) and
					Program Flow Trace Macrocell:
			"arm,coresight-etm3x", "arm,primecell";

		- Embedded Trace Macrocell (version 4.x):
			"arm,coresight-etm4x", "arm,primecell";

		- Qualcomm Configurable Replicator (version 1.x):
			"qcom,coresight-replicator1x", "arm,primecell";

		- System Trace Macrocell:
			"arm,coresight-stm", "arm,primecell"; [1]
		- Trigger Generation Unit:
			 "arm,primecell";

	* reg: physical base address and length of the register
	  set(s) of the component.

	* clocks: the clocks associated to this component.

	* clock-names: the name of the clocks referenced by the code.
	  Since we are using the AMBA framework, the name of the clock
	  providing the interconnect should be "apb_pclk", and some
	  coresight blocks also have an additional clock "atclk", which
	  clocks the core of that coresight component. The latter clock
	  is optional.

	* port or ports: The representation of the component's port
	  layout using the generic DT graph presentation found in
	  "bindings/graph.txt".

	* coresight-name: unique descriptive name of the component.

* Additional required properties for System Trace Macrocells (STM):
	* reg: along with the physical base address and length of the register
	  set as described above, another entry is required to describe the
	  mapping of the extended stimulus port area.

	* reg-names: the only acceptable values are "stm-base" and
	  "stm-stimulus-base", each corresponding to the areas defined in "reg".

* Required properties for devices that don't show up on the AMBA bus, such as
  non-configurable replicators:

	* compatible: Currently supported value is (note the absence of the
	  AMBA markee):

		- "qcom,coresight-hwevent"
		- "qcom,coresight-dummy"
		- "qcom,coresight-dbgui"

	* port or ports: same as above.

	* coresight-name: unique descriptive name of the component.

* Additional required property for coresight-dummy devices:
	* qcom,dummy-source: Configure the device as source.

	* qcom,dummy-sink: Configure the device as sink.

* Additional required property for coresight-tgu devices:
	* tgu-steps: must be present. Indicates number of steps supported
	  by the TGU.
	* tgu-conditions: must be present. Indicates the number of conditions
	  supported by the TGU.

	  by the TGU.
	* tgu-timer-counters: must be present. Indicates the number of timers and
	  counters available in the TGU to do a comparision.

* Optional properties for all components:
	* reg-names: names corresponding to each reg property value.

* Optional properties for ETM/PTMs:

	* arm,cp14: must be present if the system accesses ETM/PTM management
	  registers via co-processor 14.

	  source is considered to belong to CPU0.

	 (embedded trace router)

	* arm,sg-enable : indicates whether scatter gather feature is enabled
	  by default for TMC ETR configuration.

* Required property for TPDAs:

	* qcom,tpda-atid: must be present. Specifies the ATID for TPDA.

* Optional properties for TPDAs:

	* qcom,bc-elem-size: specifies the BC element size supported by each
	  monitor connected to the aggregator on each port. Should be specified
          in pairs (port, bc element size).

	* qcom,tc-elem-size: specifies the TC element size supported by each
	  monitor connected to the aggregator on each port. Should be specified
	  in pairs (port, tc element size).

	  existing funnel. Funnel devices are now capable of supporting
	  multiple-input and multiple-output configuration with in built
	  hardware filtering for TPDM devices. Each set of input-output
	  combination is treated as independent funnel device.
	  funnel-base-dummy and funnel-base-real reg-names must be specified
	  when this property is enabled.

	* reg-names: funnel-base-dummy: dummy register space used by a
	  duplicate funnel. Should be a valid register address space that
	  no other device is using.

have the same HW interface and as such don't need an explicit binding name.
