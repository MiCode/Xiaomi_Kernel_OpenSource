* CoreSight Components:

CoreSight components are compliant with the ARM CoreSight architecture
specification and can be connected in various topologies to suit a particular
SoCs tracing needs. These trace components can generally be classified as
sinks, links and sources. Trace data produced by one or more sources flows
through the intermediate links connecting the source to the currently selected
sink. Each CoreSight component device should use these properties to describe
its hardware characteristcs.

* Required properties for all components *except* non-configurable replicators
  and non-configurable funnels:

	* compatible: These have to be supplemented with "arm,primecell" as
	  drivers are using the AMBA bus interface.  Possible values include:
		- Embedded Trace Buffer (version 1.0):
			"arm,coresight-etb10", "arm,primecell";

		- Trace Port Interface Unit:
			"arm,coresight-tpiu", "arm,primecell";

		- Trace Memory Controller, used for Embedded Trace Buffer(ETB),
		  Embedded Trace FIFO(ETF) and Embedded Trace Router(ETR)
		  configuration.  The configuration mode (ETB, ETF, ETR) is
		  discovered at boot time when the device is probed.
			"arm,coresight-tmc", "arm,primecell";

		- Trace Programmable Funnel:
			"arm,coresight-dynamic-funnel", "arm,primecell";
			"arm,coresight-funnel", "arm,primecell"; (OBSOLETE. For
				backward compatibility and will be removed)

	  set(s) of the component.

	* clocks: the clocks associated to this component.

	* clock-names: the name of the clocks referenced by the code.
	  Since we are using the AMBA framework, the name of the clock

	  clocks the core of that coresight component. The latter clock
	  is optional.

	  set as described above, another entry is required to describe the
	  mapping of the extended stimulus port area.

	  "stm-stimulus-base", each corresponding to the areas defined in "reg".

	  power collapse.

* Optional property for TMC:

	* arm,buffer-size: size of contiguous buffer space for TMC ETR

Graph bindings for Coresight
-------------------------------

Coresight components are interconnected to create a data path for the flow of
trace data generated from the "sources" to their collection points "sink".
Each coresight component must describe the "input" and "output" connections.
The connections must be described via generic DT graph bindings as described
by the "bindings/graph.txt", where each "port" along with an "endpoint"
component represents a hardware port and the connection.

 * All output ports must be listed inside a child node named "out-ports"
 * All input ports must be listed inside a child node named "in-ports".
 * Port address must match the hardware port number.

have the same HW interface and as such don't need an explicit binding name.
