Venus
=====
Required properties:
- compatible : one of:
	- "qcom,msm-vidc"
- qcom,max-hw-load: The maximum load the hardware can support expressed in units
  of macroblocks per second. The load is a reflection of hardware capability
  rather than a performance guarantee. Performance is guaranteed only up to
  advertised capability of the chipset.
- qcom,firmware-name : firmware file name to be downloaded.

Optional properties:
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts : should contain the vidc interrupt.
- qcom,load-freq-tbl : load (in macroblocks/sec) and corresponding vcodec
  clock required along with codec's config, which is a bitmap that describes
  what the clock is used for. The bitmaps are as follows:
    supports mvc encoder = 0x00000001
    supports mvc decoder = 0x00000003
    supports h264 encoder = 0x00000004
    supports h264 decoder = 0x0000000c
    supports h263 encoder = 0x00000010
    supports h263 decoder = 0x00000030
    supports mpeg1 encoder = 0x00000040
    supports mpeg1 decoder = 0x000000c0
    supports mpeg2 encoder = 0x00000100
    supports mpeg2 decoder = 0x00000300
    supports mpeg4 encoder = 0x00000400
    supports mpeg4 decoder = 0x00000c00
    supports divx_311 encoder = 0x00001000
    supports divx_311 decoder = 0x00003000
    supports divx encoder = 0x00004000
    supports divx decoder = 0x0000c000
    supports vc1 encoder = 0x00010000
    supports vc1 decoder = 0x00030000
    supports spark encoder = 0x00040000
    supports spark decoder = 0x000c0000
    supports vp6 encoder = 0x00100000
    supports vp6 decoder = 0x00300000
    supports vp7 encoder = 0x00400000
    supports vp7 decoder = 0x00c00000
    supports vp8 encoder = 0x01000000
    supports vp8 decoder = 0x03000000
    supports hevc encoder = 0x04000000
    supports hevc decoder = 0x0c000000
    supports hevc_hybrid encoder = 0x10000000
    supports hevc_hybrid decoder = 0x30000000
- qcom,reg-presets : list of offset-value pairs for registers to be written.
  The offsets are from the base offset specified in 'reg'. This is mainly
  used for QoS, VBIF, etc. presets for video.
- qcom,qdss-presets : list of physical address and memory allocation size pairs.
  when fw_debug_mode is set as HFI_DEBUG_MODE_QDSS, all firmware messages will be
  written to QDSS memory.
- qcom,imem-size: imem size required by hardware for optimum performance.
  If imem is not present then there is no need to specify this property.
- *-supply: A phandle pointing to the appropriate regulator. Number of
  regulators vary across targets.
- clock-names: an array of clocks that the driver is supposed to be
  manipulating. The clocks names here correspond to the clock names used in
  clk_get(<name>).
- qcom,clock-configs = an array of bitmaps of clocks' configurations. The index
  of the bitmap corresponds to the clock at the same index in qcom,clock-names.
  The bitmaps describes the actions that the device needs to take regarding the
  clock (i.e. scale it based on load).

  The bitmap is defined as:
  scalable = 0x1 (if the driver should vary the clock's frequency based on load)
- qcom,sw-power-collapse = A bool indicating if video hardware core can be
  power collapsed in idle state.
- qcom,early-fw-load = A bool indicating if video firmware should be loaded
  during probe. When no video session is active, the video hardware will be
  power collapsed.
- qcom,use-non-secure-pil = A bool indicating which type of pil to use to load
  the fw.
- qcom,fw-bias = The address at which venus fw is loaded (manually).
- qcom,enable-idle-indicator = A bool to enable video hardware to generate
  idle message when it is in idle state.
- qcom,enable-thermal-mitigation = A bool to enable thermal mitigation when
  thermal run away occurs.
- qcom,hfi-version = The hfi packetization version supported by venus firmware.
  If hfi version is not specified, then packetization type will default to
  legacy.

Context Banks
=============
Required properties:
- compatible : one of:
	- "qcom,msm-vidc,context-bank"
- iommus : A phandle parsed by smmu driver. Number of entries will vary
  across targets.

Optional properties:
- label - string describing iommu domain usage.
- buffer-types : bitmap of buffer types that can be mapped into the current
	IOMMU domain.
        - Buffer types are defined as the following:
          input = 0x1
          output = 0x2
          output2 = 0x4
          extradata input = 0x8
          extradata output = 0x10
          extradata output2 = 0x20
          internal scratch = 0x40
          internal scratch1 = 0x80
          internal scratch2 = 0x100
          internal persist = 0x200
          internal persist1 = 0x400
          internal cmd queue = 0x800
- virtual-addr-pool : offset and length of virtual address pool.
- qcom,fw-context-bank : bool indicating firmware context bank.
- qcom,secure-context-bank : bool indicating secure context bank.

Buses
=====
Required properties:
- compatible : one of:
	- "qcom,msm-vidc,bus"
- label : an arbitrary name
- qcom,bus-master : an integer descriptor of the bus master. Refer to arch/arm/\
  boot/dts/include/dt-bindings/msm/msm-bus-ids.h for list of acceptable masters
- qcom,bus-slave : an integer descriptor of the bus slave. Refer to arch/arm/\
  boot/dts/include/dt-bindings/msm/msm-bus-ids.h for list of acceptable slaves

Optional properties:
- qcom,bus-governor : governor to use when scaling bus, generally any commonly
  found devfreq governor might be used.  In addition to those governors, the
  custom Venus govenors, "msm-vidc-bw-ddr" or "msm-vidc-bw-vmem" are also
  acceptable values.
  In the absence of this property the "performance" governor is used.
- qcom,bus-rage-kbps : an array of two items (<min max>) that indicate the
  minimum and maximum acceptable votes for the bus.
  In the absence of this property <0 INT_MAX> is used.
