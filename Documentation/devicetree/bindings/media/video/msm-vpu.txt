* Qualcomm MSM VPU

VPU (Video Processing Unit) applies high quality video post-processing
functions like noise reduction, deinterlacing, scaling, etc in real-time
on streaming video.


Required properties:
- compatible :
    - "qcom,vpu"
- reg : Specify offset and length of the device register sets.
- reg-names : Names corresponding to the defined register sets.
    - "vpu_csr" : CSR registers
    - "vpu_smem" : Shared memory
- interrupts : Specify the vpu interrupts.
- interrupt-names : Names corresponding to the defined interrupts list.
    - "vpu_wdog" : Watchdog interrupt
    - "vpu_hfi" : Firmware to Host interrupt
- clock-names: Array of clocks that the driver requires for the device.
 The names here correspond to the clock names used in clk_get(<name>).

- qcom,maple-clk-load-freq-tbl: Table of <load, freq> entries. An entry
  specifies a given VPU processing load (in bits per second), and a
  corresponding clock frequency (in Hz) to set. Entries should be in ascending
  order of load, and their number is variable. For maple clock.
- qcom,vdp-clk-load-freq-tbl: Same as above, for vdp clock.
- qcom,bus-clk-load-freq-tbl: Same as above, for bus clock.
- qcom,bus-load-vector-tbl: Vectors of <load, ab, ib>. The (ab,ib) pairs are
  ddr bus bandwidths to be requested at corresponding video processing load.
  Vectors should be in ascending order of load, and their number is variable.
- qcom,enabled-iommu-maps: List of IOMMU maps to be enabled, defined by name.
    - "vpu_nonsecure" : IOMMU for accessing non-secure video buffers
    - "vpu_secure" : IOMMU for accessing secure video buffers
    - "vpu_firmware" : IOMMU for loading firmware image.
- vdd-supply: regulator that supplies the vpu.


Example:
	qcom,vpu@fdc00000 {
		compatible = "qcom,vpu";
		reg = <0xfdc00000 0xff000>,
			<0xbfe00000 0x100000>;
		reg-names = "vpu_csr", "vpu_smem";
		interrupts = <0 44 0>, <0 45 0>;
		interrupt-names = "vpu_wdog", "vpu_hfi";
		clock-names = "core_clk", "bus_clock", "iface_clk";
		qcom,maple-clk-load-freq-tbl = <100000 50000000>,
			<500000 400000000>;
		qcom,vdp-clk-load-freq-tbl = <200000 100000000>,
			<400000 320000000>;
		qcom,bus-clk-load-freq-tbl = <100000 40000000>,
			<200000 80000000>;
		qcom,bus-load-vector-tbl = <0 0 0>,
			<489600 536000 1600000>,
			<979200 2024000 1600000>;
		qcom,enabled-iommu-maps = "vpu_nonsecure", "vpu_secure";
		vdd-supply = <&gdsc_vpu>;
	};
