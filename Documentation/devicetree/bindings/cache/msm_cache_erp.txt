* Qualcomm Krait L1 / L2 cache error reporting driver

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "qcom,cache_erp"
- interrupts: Should contain the L1/CPU error interrupt number and
  the L2 cache interrupt number
- interrupt-names: Should contain the interrupt names "l1_irq" and
  "l2_irq"
- qcom,msm-imem-phandle: phandle reference to the imem cache erp node

Optional properties:
- reg: A set of I/O regions to be dumped in the event of a hardware fault being
  detected. If this property is present, the "reg-names" property is must be
  present as well.
- reg-names: Human-readable names assigned to the I/O regions defined by the
  "reg" property. The names can be completely arbitrary, since they are
  intended to be human-read during failure analysis, and because the set of I/O
  regions of interest may vary with the overall system design. This property
  shall only be present if the "reg" property is present, and must contain as
  many elements as the "reg" property.

Example:
	qcom,cache_erp {
		compatible = "qcom,cache_erp";
		interrupts = <1 9 0>, <0 2 0>;
		interrupt-names = "l1_irq", "l2_irq";
	};

Example with "reg" property defined:
	qcom,cache_erp@f9012000 {
		reg = <0xf9012000 0x80>,
		      <0xf9089000 0x80>,
		      <0xf9099000 0x80>;

		reg-names = "l2_saw",
			    "krait0_saw",
			    "krait1_saw";

		compatible = "qcom,cache_erp";
		interrupts = <1 9 0>, <0 2 0>;
		interrupt-names = "l1_irq", "l2_irq";

		qcom,msm-imem-phandle = <&imem_cache_erp>;
	};
