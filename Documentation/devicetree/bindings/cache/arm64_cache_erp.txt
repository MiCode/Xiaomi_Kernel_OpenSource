* ARM Cortex A53 / A57 cache error reporting driver

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "arm,arm64-cpu-erp"
- interrupts: List of hardware interrupts that may indicate an error condition
  in the CPU subsystem, or in the L1 / L2 caches. At least one interrupt entry
  is required.
- interrupt-names: Must contain one or more of the following IRQ types:
	"pri-dbe-irq" - double-bit error interrupt for primary cluster
	"sec-dbe-irq" - double-bit error interrupt for secondary cluster
	"pri-ext-irq" - external bus error interrupt for primary cluster
	"sec-ext-irq" - external bus error interrupt for secondary cluster
	"cci-irq"     - CCI error interrupt. If this property is present, having
			the 'cci' reg-base defined using the 'reg' property is
			recommended.
	"sbe-irq"     - Single-bit Error interrupt. Single-bit errors interrupts
			are generated by the pmu overflow interrupt, so this essentially
			is just the arm64 pmu interrupt. This is a percpu interrupt.
	At least one irq entry is required.

Optional properties:
- reg: Should contain physical address of the CCI register space
- reg-names: Should contain 'cci'. Must be present if 'reg' property is present
- qcom,apply-cti-pmu-wa: Indicates if the driver needs to apply the CTI PMU Workaround. Relevant for 8994V1.
- poll-delay-msec: Indicates how often the edac check callback should be called. Time in msec.

Example:
	cpu_cache_erp {
		compatible = "arm,arm64-cpu-erp";
		interrupt-names = "pri-dbe-irq",
				  "sec-dbe-irq",
				  "pri-ext-irq",
				  "sec-ext-irq";
		interrupts = <0 92 0>,
			     <0 91 0>,
			     <0 96 0>,
			     <0 95 0>;
	};
