Qualcomm Standard Secure Digital Host Controller (SDHC)

Secure Digital Host Controller provides standard host interface to SD/MMC/SDIO cards.

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "qcom,sdhci-msm"
  - reg : should contain SDHC, SD Core register map.
  - reg-names : indicates various resources passed to driver (via reg proptery) by name.
		Required "reg-names" are "hc_mem" and "core_mem"
  - interrupts : should contain SDHC interrupts.
  - interrupt-names : indicates interrupts passed to driver (via interrupts property) by name.
		      Required "interrupt-names" are "hc_irq" and "pwr_irq".
  - <supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
			  Required "supply-name" are "vdd" and "vdd-io".
  - qcom,clk-rates: this is an array that specifies supported SDHC clock
		    frequencies for a slot, Units - Hz.

Required alias:
- The slot number is specified via an alias with the following format
	'sdhc{n}' where n is the slot number.

Optional Properties:
	- interrupt-names - "status_irq". This status_irq will be used for card
			     detection.
	- cd-gpios: specify GPIO for card detection. If this property is
		    defined, then it means SDHC device has more than one interrupt
		    parent and hence, it is required to define the following properties
		    to configure interrupts from multiple parents -

		    interrupt-parent - This must provide reference to the current
				       device node.
		    #address-cells - Should provide a value of 0.
		    interrupts - Should be <0 1 2> and it is an index to the
				 interrupt-map.
		    #interrupt-cells - should provide a value of 1.
		    #interrupt-mask - should provide a value of 0xffffffff.
		    interrupt-map - Must create mapping for the number of interrupts
				    that are defined in above interrupts property.
				    For SDHC device node, it must define 3 mappings for
				    hc_irq, pwr_irq and status_irq in the format
				    mentioned in below example node of sdhc_2.

	- qcom,bus-width - defines the bus I/O width that controller supports.
			   Units - number of bits. The valid bus-width values are
			   1, 4 and 8.
	- qcom,nonremovable - specifies whether the card in slot is
			      hot pluggable or hard wired.
	- qcom,nonhotplug - specifies the card in slot is not hot pluggable.
			    if card lost or removed manually at runtime, don't retry
			    to redetect it until next reboot probe.
	- qcom,no-1p8v - specifies the system physically doesn't support 1.8v, even if the
			  host does.
	- qcom,bus-speed-mode - specifies supported bus speed modes by host.
				The supported bus speed modes are :
				"HS400_1p8v" - indicates that host can support HS400 at 1.8v.
				"HS400_1p2v" - indicates that host can support HS400 at 1.2v.
				"HS200_1p8v" - indicates that host can support HS200 at 1.8v.
				"HS200_1p2v" - indicates that host can support HS200 at 1.2v.
				"DDR_1p8v" - indicates that host can support DDR mode at 1.8v.
				"DDR_1p2v" - indicates that host can support DDR mode at 1.2v.
	- qcom,qos-planes: Allows for multiple configurations of pm_qos. If not provided defaults
			    to SDHCI_QOS_MAX_POLICY i.e 3.
	- qcom,cpu-dma-latency-us: This is the default(read/write) qos plane for sdhci.
				specifies acceptable DMA latencies(dynamic) in microseconds.
				Default value is 200 ms. If this property specified as 0,
				then SDHC driver will not vote for PM QOS.
	- qcom,cpu-dma-latency-us-r: This is Read qos plane for sdhci.
				specifies acceptable DMA latencies(dynamic) in microseconds.
				Default value is 200 ms.
	- qcom,cpu-dma-latency-us-w: This is write qos plane for sdhci.
				specifies acceptable DMA latencies(dynamic) in microseconds.
				Default value is 200 ms.

        - qcom,dat1-mpm-int:    specifies MPM interrupt number (e.g. sdhc_2 node below)
				corresponding to DAT1 line of SDHC (used only if slot has dedicated
				DAT1 MSM pin (not GPIO))

In the following, <supply> can be vdd (flash core voltage) or vdd-io (I/O voltage).
	- qcom,<supply>-always-on - specifies whether supply should be kept "on" always.
	- qcom,<supply>-lpm_sup - specifies whether supply can be kept in low power mode (lpm).
	- qcom,<supply>-voltage_level - specifies voltage levels for supply. Should be
					specified in pairs (min, max), units uV.
	- qcom,<supply>-current_level - specifies load levels for supply in lpm or
					high power mode (hpm). Should be specified in
					pairs (lpm, hpm), units uA.

	- gpios - specifies gpios assigned for sdhc slot.
	- qcom,gpio-names -  a list of strings that map in order to the list of gpios

	A slot has either gpios or dedicated tlmm pins as represented below.
	- qcom,pad-pull-on - Active pull configuration for sdc tlmm pins
	- qcom,pad-pull-off - Suspend pull configuration for sdc tlmm pins.
	- qcom,pad-drv-on - Active drive strength configuration for sdc tlmm pins.
	- qcom,pad-drv-off - Suspend drive strength configuration for sdc tlmm pins.
	Tlmm pins are specified as <clk cmd data> and starting with eMMC5.0 as
	<clk cmd data rclk>

	- qcom,bus-bw-vectors-bps: specifies array of throughput values in
	Bytes/sec. The values in the array are determined according to
	supported bus speed modes. For example, if host supports SDR12 mode,
	value is 13631488 Bytes/sec.
	- Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
	below optional properties:
	- qcom,msm-bus,name
	- qcom,msm-bus,num-cases
	- qcom,msm-bus,active-only
	- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths
	- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps

	- Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt"
	  for following optional properties:
		- pinctrl-names
		- pinctrl-0, pinctrl-1,.. pinctrl-n

        - qcom,cpu-affinity: this is a string that specifies the pm QoS request
	  type. The supported cpu affinity modes are :
	  "all_cores" - PM_QOS_REQ_ALL_CORES is applicable to all CPU cores that
	  are online and this would have a power impact when there are more
	  number of CPUs.
	  "affine_irq" - PM_QOS_REQ_AFFINE_IRQ request type shall update/apply
	  the vote only to that CPU to which this IRQ's affinity is set to.
	  "affine_cores" - PM_QOS_REQ_AFFINE_CORES request type is used for
	  targets that have little cluster and will update/apply the vote to
	  all the cores in the little cluster.
	  The default CPU affinity mode is PM_QOS_REQ_AFFINE_IRQ to maintain
	  backward compatibility.
	- qcom,cpu-affinity-r: specifies cpu-affinity type for read qos plane. Default is IRQ
				type.
	- qcom,cpu-affinity-w: specifies cpu-affinity type for write qos plane. Default is IRQ
				type.

	- qcom,cpu-affinity-mask: this is a bitmap that specifies little cluster CPU
	  cores used for PM QoS voting. This is parsed only for pm QoS request type of
	  PM_QOS_REQ_AFFINE_CORES ("affine_cores").
	- qcom,cpu-affinity-mask-r: specifies cpu-affinity mask for read qos plane.
	- qcom,cpu-affinity-mask-w: specifies cpu-affinity mask for write qos plane.

	- qcom,modified-dynamic-qos: specifies to use modified dynamic qos method. Default method
				is dynamic qos which uses default qos plane. If this is specified
				then driver uses read/write qos plane to vote for read/write
				requests based on the vote/type of qos specfied by read/write plane.
