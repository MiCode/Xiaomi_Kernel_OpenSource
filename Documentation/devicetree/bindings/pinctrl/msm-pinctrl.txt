MSM TLMM pinmux controller

Qualcomm MSM integrates a GPIO and Pin mux/config hardware, (TOP Level Mode
Multiplexer in short TLMM). It controls the input/output settings on the
available pads/pins and also provides ability to multiplex and configure the
output of various on-chip controllers onto these pads. The pins are also of
different types, encapsulating different functions and having differing register
semantics.

 Required Properties:
 - compatible: should be one of the following.
   - "qcom,msm-tlmm-v3": for MSM with TLMM version 3.

 - reg: Base address of the pin controller hardware module and length of
   the address space it occupies.

- Pin types as child nodes: Pin types supported by a particular controller
  instance are represented as child nodes of the controller node. Each
  pin type node must contain following properties:

   Required Properties
   - qcom,pin-type-*: identifies the pin type. Pin types supported are
			qcom,pin-type-gp: General purpose
			qcom,pin-type-sdc: SDC
   - #qcom,pin-cells: number of cells in the pin type specifier.
   - qcom,num-pins: number of pins of given type present on the MSM.
   Optional: A pintype may support gpio operations. In that case, a pintype
   node can have an additional child node representing a gpio controller.
   - #gpio-controller: Can be used as a gpio controller
   - #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and the
			second cell is used to specify optional parameters

- Pin groups as child nodes: The pin mux (selecting pin function
  mode) and pin config (pull up/down, driver strength, direction) settings are
  represented as child nodes of the pin-controller node. There is no limit on
  the count of these child nodes.

   Required Properties
     -qcom,pins: phandle specifying pin type and a pin number.
     -qcom,num-grp-pins: number of pins in the group.
     -label: name to identify the pin group to be used by a client.

   Optional Properties
     -qcom,pin-func: function setting for the pin group.

  The child node should contain a list of pin(s) on which a particular pin
  function selection or pin configuration (or both) have to applied. This
  list of pins is specified using the property name "qcom,pins". There
  should be atleast one pin specified for this property and there is no upper
  limit on the count of pins that can be specified. The pins are specified
  using the pintype phandle and the pin number within that pintype.

  The pin function selection that should be applied on the pins listed in the
  child node is specified using the "qcom,pin-func" property. The value
  of this property that should be applied to each of the pins listed in the
  "qcom,pins" property, should be picked from the hardware manual of the SoC.
  This property is optional in the child node if no specific function
  selection is desired for the pins listed in the child node or if the pin is
  to be used for bit banging.

  The pin group node must additionally have a pin configuration node as its own
  child node. There can be more then one such configuration node for a pin group
  node. There can be one or more configurations within the configuration
  node. These configurations are applied to all pins mentioned above using the
  "qcom,pins" property. These configurations are specific to the pintype of the
  pins.

  For the pin configuration properties supported by both pin types lookup
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt

  The values specified by these config properties should be derived from the
  hardware manual and these values are programmed as-is into the pin config
  register of the pin-controller.

  NOTE: A pin group node should be formed for all pins that are going to have
  the same function and configuration settings. If a subset of pins to be used
  by a client require different function or configuration settings or both
  then they should be modelled as a separate pin group node to be used by
  the client.

  The client nodes that require a particular pin function selection and/or
  pin configuration should use the bindings listed in the "pinctrl-bindings txt"
  file.

  For TLMMv3, in case of SDC pintype, we model it as containing 6 pins. 3 each
  for SDC1 and SDC2. Pins 0-2 corresponds to clock, data and command lines of
  SDC1 and Pins 3-5 correspond to clock, data and command lines of SDC2.

  Example 1: A pin-controller node with pin types

	pinctrl@fd5110000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-tlmm-v3";
		reg = <0xfd5110000 0x4000>;

		/* General purpose pin type */
		gp: gp {
			qcom,pin-type-gp;
			qcom,num-pins = <117>;
			#qcom,pin-cells = <1>;
			/* Supports Gpio controller */
			msm_gpio: msm_gpio {
				#gpio-controller;
				#gpio-cells = <2>;
			};
		};
		/* Sdc pin type */
		sdc: sdc {
			qcom,pin-type-sdc;
			qcom,num-pins = <6>;
			#qcom,pin-cells = <1>;
		};
	};

Example 2: Spi pin entries within the pincontroller node
	pinctrl@fd511000 {
		....
		..
		pmx-spi-bus {
			/*
			 * MOSI, MISO and CLK lines
			 * all sharing same function and config
			 * settings for each configuration node.
			 */
			qcom,pins = <&gp 0>, <&gp 1>, <&gp 3>;
			qcom,num-grp-pins = <3>;
			qcom,pin-func = <1>;
			label = "spi-bus";

			/* Active configuration of bus pins */
			spi-bus-active: spi-bus-active {
				/*
				 * Property names as specified in
				 * pinctrl-bindings.txt
				 */
				drive-strength = <8>; /* 8 MA */
				bias-disable; /* No PULL */
			};
			/* Sleep configuration of bus pins */
			spi-bus-sleep: spi-bus-sleep {
				/*
				 * Property values as specified in HW
				 * manual.
				 */
				drive-strength = <2>; /* 2 MA */
				bias-disable;
			};
		};

		pmx-spi-cs {
			/*
			 * Chip select for SPI
			 * different config
			 * settings as compared to bus pins.
			 */
			qcom,pins = <&gp 2>;
			qcom,num-grp-pins = <1>;
			qcom,pin-func = <1>;
			label = "spi-cs"

			/* Active configuration of cs pin */
			spi-cs-active: spi-cs-active {
				/*
				 * Property names as specified in
				 * pinctrl-bindings.txt
				 */
				drive-strength = <4>; /* 4 MA */
				bias-disable; /* No PULL */
			};
			/* Sleep configuration of cs pin */
			spi-cs-sleep: spi-cs-sleep {
				/*
				 * Property values as specified in HW
				 * manual.
				 */
				drive-strength = <2>; /* 2 MA */
				bias-disable = <0>; /* No PULL */
			};
		};
	};

Example 3: Same pin group with different pin function settings modelled as
separate nodes
	pinctrl@fd511000 {
		...
		..
		pmx-wcnss-5wire-active {
			qcom,pins = <&gp 40>, <&gp 41>, <&gp 42>, <&gp 43>.
					<&gp 44>;
			qcom,pin-func = <1>;
			qcom,num-grp-pins = <5>;
			label = "wcnss-5wire-active";
			wcnss-5wire-active: wcnss-active {
				drive-strength = <6>; / * 6MA */
				bias-pull-up;
			};
		};
		pmx-wcnss-5wire-suspend {
			qcom,pins = <&gp 40>, <&gp 41>, <&gp 42>, <&gp 43>.
					<&gp 44>;
			qcom,pin-func = <0>;
			qcom,num-grp-pins = <5>;
			label = "wcnss-5wire-suspend";
			wcnss-5wire-sleep: wcnss-sleep {
				drive-strength = <6>; / * 6MA */
				bias-pull-down;
			};
		};
	};

Example 4: SDC pins

	pinctrl@0xfd511000 {
		...
		..
		pmx-sdc1_clk {
			qcom,pins = <&sdc 0>;
			qcom,num-grp-pins = <1>;
			label = "sdc1-clk";
			sdc1_clk_on: clk_on {
				bias-disable; /* NO pull */
				drive-strength = <12>; /* 12 MA */
			};
			sdc1_clk_off: clk_off {
				bias-disable; /* NO pull */
				drive-strength = <2>; /* 2 MA */

		};
		pmx-sdc1_cmd {
			qcom,pins = <&sdc 1>;
			qcom,num-grp-pins = <1>;
