Qualcomm Technologies QPNP WLED

QPNP (Qualcomm Technologies Plug N Play) WLED (White Light
Emitting Diode) driver is used for controlling display
backlight that is part of PMIC on Qualcomm Technologies
reference platforms. The PMIC is connected to the host
processor via SPMI bus.

Required properties:
- compatible		: should be "qcom,qpnp-wled"
- reg			: base address and size for wled modules
- reg-names		: names associated with base addresses. It
			should be "qpnp-wled-ctrl-base", "qpnp-wled-sink-base",
			"qpnp-wled-ibb-base", "qpnp-wled-lab-base".

Optional properties for WLED:
- linux,name		: name of the wled. default is "wled".
- linux,default-trigger	: trigger for the backlight. default is NONE.
- qcom,fdbk-output	: string feedback current output for wled module. The accepted values
			  are "wled1", "wled2", "wled3", "wled4" and "auto". default is "auto".
- qcom,vref-mv		: maximum reference voltage in mv. default is 350.
- qcom,switch-freq-khz	: switch frequency in khz. default is 800.
- qcom,ovp-mv		: over voltage protection value in mv. default is 17800.
- qcom,ilim-ma		: maximum current limiter in ma. default is 980.
- qcom,boost-duty-ns	: maximum boost duty cycle in ns. default is 104.
- qcom,mod-freq-khz	: modulation frequency in khz. default is 19200.
- qcom,dim-mode		: dimming mode. supporting dimming modes are "analog",
			  "digital", and "hybrid". default is "hybrid".
- qcom,dim-method	: dimming method. supported dimming methods are "log", "square",
			  and "linear". default is "linear".
- qcom,hyb-thres	: threshold value when used in hybrid mode. It represents the
			  percentage of brightntess at which dimming mode is switched
			  from "digital" to "analog". the default value is 6.25%. as the
			  floating point cannot be represented directly, the value is
			  multiplied by 100. so the default is 625.
- qcom,sync-dly-us	: delay for current sync in us. default is 400.
- qcom,fs-curr-ua	: maximum full scale current in ua. default is 25000.
- qcom,en-9b-dim-res	: boolean, specify if 9-bit dim resultion is needed. otherwise 12-bit is used.
- qcom,en-phase-stag	: boolean, specify if phase staggering is needed.
- qcom,en-cabc		: boolean, specify if cabc (content adaptive backlight control) is needed.
- qcom,ibb-bias-active	: boolean, specify to activate the bias
- qcom,ibb-pwrup-dly	: ibb power up delay in milli seconds. The supported values are 1 to 8.
			  default is 1.
- qcom,lab-fast-precharge: boolean, specify to activate the fast precharge
- qcom,disp-type-amoled	: specify if the display is amoled
- qcom,led-strings-list	: Wled module has four strings of leds numbered from 0 to 3. each string of leds
			  are operated individually. specify the list of strings used by the device.
			  any combination of led strings can be used. default value is [00 01 02 03]
