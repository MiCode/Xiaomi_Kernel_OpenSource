Qualcomm Technologies QPNP WLED

QPNP (Qualcomm Technologies Plug N Play) WLED (White Light
Emitting Diode) driver is used for controlling display
backlight that is part of PMIC on Qualcomm Technologies
reference platforms. The PMIC is connected to the host
processor via SPMI bus.

Required properties:
- compatible		: should be "qcom,qpnp-wled"
- reg			: base address and size for wled modules
- reg-names		: names associated with base addresses. It
			should be "qpnp-wled-ctrl-base", "qpnp-wled-sink-base",
			"qpnp-wled-ibb-base", "qpnp-wled-lab-base".
- qcom,pmic-revid	: phandle of PMIC revid module. This is used to
			  identify the PMIC subtype.

Optional properties for WLED:
 - interrupts		: Specifies the interrupts associated with WLED. The available
			  interrupts are over voltage protection(ovp) and short circuit(sc).
			  The values for ovp and sc are <0x3 0xd8 0x1> and <0x3 0xd8 0x2>.
 - interrupt-names	: Specify the interrupt names associated with interrupts. Must be
			  one of "ovp-irq" or "sc-irq"
- linux,name		: name of the wled. default is "wled".
- linux,default-trigger	: trigger for the backlight. default is NONE.
- qcom,fdbk-output	: string feedback current output for wled module. The accepted values
			  are "wled1", "wled2", "wled3", "wled4" and "auto". default is "auto".
- qcom,vref-mv		: maximum reference voltage in mv. default is 350.
- qcom,switch-freq-khz	: switch frequency in khz. default is 800.
- qcom,ovp-mv		: Over voltage protection threshold in mV. Default is
			  29500. Supported values are:
			  - 31000, 29500, 19400, 17800 for pmi8994/8952/8996.
			  - 31100, 29600, 19600, 18100 for pmicobalt/pm2falcon.
			  Should only be used if qcom,disp-type-amoled is not
			  specified.
- qcom,ilim-ma		: maximum current limiter in ma. default is 980.
- qcom,boost-duty-ns	: maximum boost duty cycle in ns. default is 104.
- qcom,mod-freq-khz	: modulation frequency in khz. default is 9600.
- qcom,dim-mode		: dimming mode. supporting dimming modes are "analog",
			  "digital", and "hybrid". default is "hybrid".
- qcom,hyb-thres	: threshold value when used in hybrid mode. It represents the
			  percentage of brightntess at which dimming mode is switched
			  from "digital" to "analog". the default value is 6.25%. as the
			  floating point cannot be represented directly, the value is
			  multiplied by 100. so the default is 625.
- qcom,sync-dly-us	: delay for current sync in us. default is 400.
- qcom,fs-curr-ua	: maximum full scale current in ua. default is 25000.
- qcom,en-9b-dim-res	: boolean, specify if 9-bit dim resultion is needed. otherwise 12-bit is used.
- qcom,en-phase-stag	: boolean, specify if phase staggering is needed.
- qcom,en-cabc		: boolean, specify if cabc (content adaptive backlight control) is needed.
- qcom,disp-type-amoled	: specify if the display is amoled
- qcom,led-strings-list	: Wled module has four strings of leds numbered from 0 to 3. each string of leds
			  are operated individually. specify the list of strings used by the device.
			  any combination of led strings can be used. default value is [00 01 02 03]
- qcom,en-ext-pfet-sc-pro : Specify if external pfet short circuit protection is needed
- qcom,cons-sync-write-delay-us : Specify in 'us' the duration of delay between two consecutive writes to
				  SYNC register.
- qcom,sc-deb-cycles	: debounce time for short circuit detection

Optional properties if 'qcom,disp-type-amoled' is mentioned in DT:
- qcom,loop-ea-gm	: control the gm for gm stage in control loop. default is 3.
- qcom,loop-comp-res-kohm	: control to select the compensation resistor in kohm. default is 320.
- qcom,vref-psm-mv	: reference psm voltage in mv. default for amoled is 450.
- qcom,avdd-mode-spmi: Boolean property to enable AMOLED_VOUT programming via SPMI. If not specified,
			AMOLED_VOUT is programmed via S-wire. This can be specified only for newer
			PMICs like pmicobalt/pm2falcon.
- qcom,avdd-target-voltage-mv: The voltage required for AMOLED_VOUT. Accepted values are in the range
				of 5650 to 7900 in steps of 150. Default value is 7600. Unit is in mV.
				For old revisions, accepted values are: 7900, 7600, 7300, 6400, 6100,
				5800.
