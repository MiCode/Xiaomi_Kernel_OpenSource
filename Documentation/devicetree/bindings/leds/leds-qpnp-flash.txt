Qualcomm Technologies PNP Flash LED

QPNP (Qualcomm Technologies Plug N Play) Flash LED (Light
Emitting Diode) driver is used to provide illumination to
camera sensor when background light is dim to capture good
picture. It can also be used for flashlight/torch application.
It is part of PMIC on Qualcomm Technologies reference platforms.
The PMIC is connected to the host processor via SPMI bus.

                                   current, based on PMIC die temperature threshold to

				  needed if PMIC is older than PMI8994v2.0.
- qcom,die-temp-threshold       : Integer type array for PMIC die temperature threshold.
				  Array should have at least one value. Values should be in
				  celcius. This property is not needed if PMIC is older than
				  PMI8994v2.0.
- qcom,die-temp-derate-current	: Integer type arrray for PMIC die temperature derate
				  current. Array should have at least one value. Values
				  should be in mA. This property is not needed if PMIC is older
				  than PMI8994v2.0.

Required properties inside child node. Chile node contains settings for each individual LED.
Each LED hardware needs a node for itself and a switch node to control brightness.
For the purpose of turning on/off LED and better regulator control, "led:switch" node
is introduced. "led:switch" acquires several existing properties from other nodes for
operational simplification. For backward compatibility purpose, switch node can be optional:
- label			: type of led that will be used, either "flash" or "torch".
- qcom,led-name		: name of the LED. Accepted values are "led:flash_0",
			  "led:flash_1", "led:torch_0", "led:torch_1"
- qcom,default-led-trigger	: trigger for the camera flash and torch. Accepted values are
				"flash0_trigger", "flash1_trigger", "torch0_trigger", torch1_trigger"
- qcom,id		: enumerated ID for each physical LED. Accepted values are "0",
			  "1", etc..
- qcom,max-current	: maximum current allowed on this LED. Valid values should be
			  integer from 0 to 1000 inclusive, indicating 0 to 1000 mA.
- qcom,pmic-revid	: PMIC revision id source. This property is needed for PMI8996
			revision check.

Optional properties inside child node:
- qcom,current		: default current intensity for LED. Accepted values should be
			  integer from 0 t 1000 inclusive, indicating 0 to 1000 mA.
- qcom,duration	: Duration for flash LED. When duration time expires, hardware will turn off
		flash LED. Values should be from 10 ms to 1280 ms with 10 ms incremental
		step. Not applicable to torch. It is required for LED:SWITCH node to handle
		LED used as flash.
- reg<n>	: reg<n> (<n> represents number. eg 0,1,2,..) property is to add support for
		multiple power sources. It includes two properties regulator-name and max-voltage.
		Required property inside regulator node:
		- regulator-name	: This denotes this node is a regulator node and which
					regulator to use.
		Optional property inside regulator node:
		- max-voltage		: This specifies max voltage of regulator. Some switch
					or boost regulator does not need this property.
