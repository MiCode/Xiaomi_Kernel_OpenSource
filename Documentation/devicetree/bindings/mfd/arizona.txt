    and may provide interrupt services to other devices.
  - interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.
  - #interrupt-cells: the number of cells to describe an IRQ, this should be 2.
    The first cell is the IRQ number.
    The second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupts.txt

  - #gpio-cells : Must be 2. The first cell is the pin number and the
    second cell is used to specify optional parameters (currently unused).

    presence

    debounce specified in milliseconds
  - wlf,micd-pol-gpio : GPIO specifier for the GPIO controlling the headset
    polarity if one exists

    performing microphone detection, specified as per the MICD_BIAS_STARTTIME
    bits in the register MIC_DETECT_1

    milliseconds
  - wlf,micd-force-micbias : Force MICBIAS continuously on during microphone
    detection
  - wlf,micd-ranges : Microphone detection level and key configuration, this
    field can be of variable length but should always be a multiple of 2 cells
    long, each two cell group represents one button configuration
    The first cell is the maximum impedance for this button in ohms
    The second cell the key that should be reported to the input layer
  - wlf,micd-configs : Headset polarity configurations, the field can be of
    variable length but should always be a multiple of 3 cells long, each two
    cell group represents one polarity configration
    The first cell is the accessory detection source as per the ACCDET_SRC bits
    in the ACCESSORY_DETECT_MODE_1 register
    The second cell represents the MICBIAS to be used as per the MICD_BIAS_SRC
    bits in the MIC_DETECT_1 register
    The third cell represents the value of the micd-pol-gpio pin, a non-zero
    value indicates this should be on
  - wlf,init-mic-delay : Adds a delay in milliseconds between jack detection
    and beginning ramp of MICBIAS.

  - wlf,micbias1 : Configuration for the micbias regulator, should include 5
    cells.
    The first cell is the output voltage in millivolts
    The second cell a non-zero value indicates an external capacitor is fitted
    The third cell a non-zero value indicates the micbias should be actively
    discharged
    The four cell a non-zero value indicates that the micbias should be
    brought up slowly to reduce pops
    The fifth cell a non-zero value indicates the micbias should be bypassed
    and simply output MICVDD
  - wlf,micbias2 : See wlf,micbias1
  - wlf,micbias3 : See wlf,micbias1

  - wlf,gpio-defaults : A list of GPIO configuration register values. If
    absent, no configuration of these registers is performed. If any
    entry has a value that is out of range for a 16 bit register then
    the chip default will be used.  If present exactly five values must
    be specified.

  - wlf,max-channels-clocked : The maximum number of channels to be clocked on
    each AIF, useful for I2S systems with multiple data lines being mastered.
    If specified three cells must supplied one for each AIF, specify zero for
    AIFs that should be handled normally.

  - wlf,dmic-ref : DMIC reference for each input, must contain four cells if
    specified. 0 indicates MICVDD and is the default, 1,2,3 indicate the
    respective MICBIAS.

  - wlf,inmode : Input mode for each input, must contain four cells if
    specified. 0 indicates Differential, 1 indicates Single Ended and 2
    indicates a digital microphone.

  - wlf,use-jd-gpio : Use GPIO input for jack detection.
  - wlf,usr-jd-gpio-nopull : Internal pull on GPIO is disabled when used for
    jack detection.

  - wlf,gpsw : Settings for the general purpose switch, set as per the
    SW1_MODE bits in the GP Switch 1 register

    wlf,wm5102t-output-pwr : Output power setting (WM5102T only)

  - wlf,fixed-hpdet-imp : Do not perform any headphone detection, just use
    the fixed value specified here as the headphone impedance.

  - DCVDD-supply, MICVDD-supply : Power supplies, only need to be specified if
    they are being externally supplied. As covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

Optional subnodes:
  - ldo1 : Initial data for the LDO1 regulator, as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt
  - micvdd : Initial data for the MICVDD regulator, as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt
