msm_sharedmem provides the shared memory addresses for various clients in user-space

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,sharedmem-uio"
- reg : The address and size of the shared memory. The address/sizes may vary.
	A reg address of Zero indicates that the shared memory is dynamically
	allocated using dma_alloc_coherent. A non zero reg address is used
	directly.
- reg-names : Indicates various client-names.
- qcom,client-id : The client id for the QMI clients.

Example:
	qcom,msm_sharedmem@0dc80000 {
		compatible = "qcom,sharedmem-uio";
		reg = <0x0dc80000 0x00180000>,
		reg-names = "rmtfs";
		qcom,client-id = <0x00000001>;
	};
