Qualcomm I2C controller

Required properties:
 - reg : Offset and length of the register region for the device named in
	reg-names and has the same index.
 - reg-names : Register region name(s) referenced in reg above
	"qup_phys_addr" : Physical address of QUP register space.
	"bam_phys_addr" : Physical address of BAM for this controller.
 - compatible : should be "qcom,i2c-msm-v2"
 - interrupts : Interrupt number which correspond to the entry with the same
	index in interrupt-names.
 - interrupt-names: QUP core interrupt name(s) referenced in interrupts above
	"qup_irq" : QUP interrupt used by the controller.
	"bam_irq" : BAM interrupt used by the controller.
 - qcom,clk-freq-out : Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz
 - qcom,clk-freq-in  : Supplied core clock frequency in Hz.
 - qcom,bam-pipe-idx-cons : BAM consumer-pipe index.
 - qcom,bam-pipe-idx-prod : BAM producer-pipe index.

Required alias:
 - The desired bus-number is specified by an alias with the following format:
	'i2c{n}' where n is the bus number.

Optional property:
 - qcom,noise-rjct-scl : number of low samples on clock line to consider it low.
	When missing default to 0.
 - qcom,noise-rjct-sda : number of low samples on data  line to consider it low.
	When missing default to 0.
 - qcom,bam-disable : disables BAM transfer mode.
 - qcom,master-id : Master-port value used on voting for the clock path.
 - qcom,clk-ctl-xfer   : When present, the clocks's state (prepare_enable/
		       unprepare_disable) is controlled by i2c-transaction's
		       begining and ending. When missing, the clock's state
		       is controlled by runtime-pm events.

Example:
	aliases {
		i2c10 = &i2c_10;
	};

	i2c_10: i2c@f9966000 {
		compatible = "qcom,i2c-msm-v2";
		reg-names = "qup_phys_addr", "bam_phys_addr";
		reg = <0xf9966000 0x1000>,
		      <0xf9904000 0x10000>;
		interrupt-names = "qup_irq", "bam_irq";
		interrupts = <0 104 0>, <0 238 0>;
		qcom,clk-freq-out = <100000>;
		qcom,clk-freq-in  = <24000000>;
		qcom,noise-rjct-scl = <0>;
		qcom,noise-rjct-sda = <0>;
		qcom,bam-pipe-idx-cons = <18>;
		qcom,bam-pipe-idx-prod = <19>;
	};
