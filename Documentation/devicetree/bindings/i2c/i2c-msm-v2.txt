Qualcomm I2C controller

Required properties:
 - reg : Offset and length of the register region for the device named in
	reg-names and has the same index.
 - reg-names : Register region name(s) referenced in reg above
	"qup_phys_addr" : Physical address of QUP register space.
	"bam_phys_addr" : Physical address of BAM for this controller.
 - compatible : should be "qcom,i2c-qup"
 - interrupts : Interrupt number which correspond to the entry with the same
	index in interrupt-names.
 - interrupt-names: QUP core interrupt name(s) referenced in interrupts above
	"qup_irq" : QUP interrupt used by the controller.
	"bam_irq" : BAM interrupt used by the controller.
 - qcom,clk-freq-out : Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz
 - qcom,clk-freq-in  : Supplied core clock frequency in Hz.
 - qcom,bam-pipe-idx-cons : BAM consumer-pipe index.
 - qcom,bam-pipe-idx-prod : BAM producer-pipe index.

Required alias:
 - The desired bus-number is specified by an alias with the following format:
	'i2c{n}' where n is the bus number.

Optional property:
 - qcom,noise-rjct-scl : number of low samples on clock line to consider it low.
	When missing default to 0.
 - qcom,noise-rjct-sda : number of low samples on data  line to consider it low.
	When missing default to 0.
 - qcom,bam-disable : disables BAM transfer mode.
 - qcom,master-id : Master-port value used on voting for the clock path.
 - qcom,active-only  : Vote for core clock when the application processor goes
	to active state and remove that vote when it goes to idle state. This
	flag may improve service time of first i2c request at the expense of
	power consumption. When this entry is not present, voting is done by the
	runtime-pm callbacks.

Example:
	aliases {
		i2c10 = &i2c_10;
	};

	i2c_10: i2c@f9966000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-i2c-v2";
		reg-names = "qup_phys_addr", "bam_phys_addr";
		reg = <0xf9966000 0x1000>,
		      <0xf9904000 0x10000>;
		interrupt-names = "qup_irq", "bam_irq";
		interrupts = <0 104 0>, <0 238 0>;
		qcom,clk-freq-out = <100000>;
		qcom,clk-freq-in  = <24000000>;
		qcom,noise-rjct-scl = <0>;
		qcom,noise-rjct-sda = <0>;
		qcom,bam-pipe-idx-cons = <18>;
		qcom,bam-pipe-idx-prod = <19>;
	};
