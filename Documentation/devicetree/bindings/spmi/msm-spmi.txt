* SPMI

The spmi Device Tree support interprets up to two levels of Device Tree
topology. The first level is required and specifies only a slave address.
The second level is optional and allows for the specification of different
offsets within the same 16-bit address space underneath a particular SPMI
slave ID. Within the second level, any number of address ranges can be
associated with a particular device within that 16-bit range.

First level

Required properites :

 - reg: SPMI Slave ID (0-15) with no size cell.
 - compatible : "qcom," prefixed string to match against the driver.

Recommended properties :

 - interrupts : <a b c> where a is the slave ID, b is the peripheral ID,
   c is the device interrupt number (0-7). Each device supports any arbitrary
   number of interrupts.
 - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
   services interrupts for this device.

Second level

Required properties :
 - spmi-slave-container: Used by the parser to understand that this is the
   second level of the tree.
 - reg: <a b> where a is < 65536 and b is a size. Each device supports an
   arbitrary number of address ranges.
 - compatible : "qcom," prefixed string to match against the driver.

Recommended properties :

 - interrupts : <a b c> where a is the slave ID, b is is the peripheral ID,
   c is the device interrupt number (0-7). Each device supports any arbitrary
   number of interrupts.
 - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
   services interrupts for this device.

Example:

/ {
	qcom,spmi@fc4c0000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		interrupt-parent = <&qpnpint>;
		pmic8941@d {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;
			reg = <0xd>;
			spmi-slave-container;

			coincell@2800 {
				compatible = "qcom,qpnp-coincell";
				reg = <0x2800 0x4000>;
				interrupts = <0xd 0x28 0x6  0xd 0x28 0x3>;

			};
			pon@800 {
				compatible = "qcom,qpnp-pon";
				reg = <0x800 0x4000>;
			};
		};
		customer_dev@2 {
			compatible = "qcom,qpnp-pon";
			reg = <0x2>;
			interrupts = <0x2 0x08 0x1  0x2 0x8 0x3>;
		};
	};
};
