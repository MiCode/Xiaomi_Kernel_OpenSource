* SPMI

The SPMI Device Tree support interprets up to three levels of Device Tree
topology. The first level is required and specifies only a slave address.
The second level is optional and allows for the specification of different
device nodes within the same 16-bit address space underneath a particular
SPMI slave ID. Within the second level, any number of address ranges can be
associated with a particular device within that 16-bit range. An additional
flag allows for the possiblity to specify that all device nodes should
have their resources dedicated to only one spmi_device. This flag can
be specified at the second level, or an optional third level. By default
without this flag, one spmi_device is created for each device_node.

[Root Node]

Recommended properties :
 - interrupt-controller : Used to specify the root node as the
   interrupt controller for SPMI devices.
 - #interrupt-cells : The number of cells used to express one interrupt.

Notes :
 - It is considered an error to include either spmi-container-dev or
 spmi-slave-dev in the Root Node.

[First Level Nodes]

Required properites :

 - reg: SPMI Slave ID (0-15) with no size cell.
 - compatible : "qcom," prefixed string to match against the driver.

Recommended properties :

 - interrupts : <a b c> where a is the slave ID, b is the peripheral ID,
   c is the device interrupt number (0-7). Each device supports any arbitrary
   number of interrupts.
 - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
   services interrupts for this device.

[Second Level Nodes]

Required properties :
 - spmi-slave-container: Used by the parser to understand that this is the
   second level of the tree that includes device nodes associated with the
   same slave_id.
 - reg: <a b> where a is < 65536 and b is a size. Each device supports an
   arbitrary number of address ranges.
 - compatible : "qcom," prefixed string to match against the driver.

Recommended properties :

 - interrupts : <a b c> where a is the slave ID, b is the peripheral ID,
   c is the device interrupt number (0-7). Each device supports any arbitrary
   number of interrupts.
 - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
   services interrupts for this device.

Optional properties :

 - spmi-dev-container: This specifies that all the device nodes specified for
   this slave_id should have their resources coalesced into only one
   spmi_device.

[Third Level Nodes]

Required properties :

  - spmi-dev-container: This specifies that all the device nodes specified for
   this slave_id should have their resources coalesced into only one
   spmi_device.
  - reg: <a b> where a is < 65536 and b is a size. Each device supports an
   arbitrary number of address ranges.
  - compatible : "qcom," prefixed string to match against the driver.

Recommended properties :

 - interrupts : <a b c> where a is the slave ID, b is the peripheral ID,
   c is the device interrupt number (0-7). Each device supports any arbitrary
   number of interrupts.
 - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
   services interrupts for this device.

Notes :
 - It is considered an error to include spmi-slave-dev at this level.
