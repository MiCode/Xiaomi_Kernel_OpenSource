                                apps based flow control is needed for tethered
                                call.
IPA pipe sub nodes (A2 static pipes configurations):

-label: two labels are supported, a2-to-ipa and ipa-to-a2 which
supply static configuration for A2-IPA connection.
-qcom,src-bam-physical-address: The physical address of the source BAM
-qcom,ipa-bam-mem-type:The memory type:
                       0(Pipe memory), 1(Private memory), 2(System memory)
-qcom,src-bam-pipe-index: Source pipe index
-qcom,dst-bam-physical-address: The physical address of the
                                destination BAM
-qcom,dst-bam-pipe-index: Destination pipe index
-qcom,data-fifo-offset: Data fifo base offset

Optional properties:
-qcom,ipa-pipe-mem: Specifies the base physical address and the
                    size of the IPA pipe memory region.
                    Pipe memory is a feature which may be supported by the
                    target (HW platform). The Driver support using pipe
                    memory instead of system memory. In case this property
                    will not appear in the IPA DTS entry, the driver will
                    use system memory.
- clocks: This property shall provide a list of entries each of which
    contains a phandle to clock controller device and a macro that is
    the clock's name in hardware.This should be "clock_rpm" as clock
    controller phandle and "clk_ipa_clk" as macro for "iface_clk"
- clock-names: This property shall contain the clock input names used
    by driver in same order as the clocks property.This should be "iface_clk"
