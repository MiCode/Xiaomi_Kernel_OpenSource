                    memory instead of system memory. In case this property
                    will not appear in the IPA DTS entry, the driver will
                    use system memory.

    the clock's name in hardware.This should be "clock_rpm" as clock
    controller phandle and "clk_ipa_clk" as macro for "iface_clk"

    by driver in same order as the clocks property.This should be "iface_clk"
