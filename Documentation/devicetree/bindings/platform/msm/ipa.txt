                    memory instead of system memory. In case this property
                    will not appear in the IPA DTS entry, the driver will
                    use system memory.

    contains a phandle to clock controller device and a macro that is
    the clock's name in hardware.This should be "clock_rpm" as clock
    controller phandle and "clk_ipa_clk" as macro for "iface_clk"
- clock-names: This property shall contain the clock input names used
    by driver in same order as the clocks property.This should be "iface_clk"

    IPA/GSI programmable registers reside.  This property is used only
    with the IPA/GSI emulation system, which is connected to and
    communicated with via PCIe.
