Qualcomm PMICs.  The PMIC is connected to Host processor
via SPMI bus.

Required Properties:
 - status: default status is set to "disabled.  Must be "okay"
 - compatible: must be "qcom,qpnp-vibrator"
 - label: name which describes the device
 - reg: address of device

Optional Properties:
 - qcom,vib-timeout-ms: timeout of vibrator, in ms.  Default 15000 ms
 - qcom,vib-vtg-level-mV: voltage level, in mV.  Default 3100 mV
 - qcom,mode: mode in which vibrator is operating. It can be one of
		"manual", "dtest1", "dtest2" and "dtest3"
 - qcom,active-low: boolean to specify if the dtestx is operated
		in active low or high

Required Properties for "dtestx" mode:
 - qcom,pwm-channel: pwm channel number
 - qcom,period-us: period for pwm in micro secs
 - qcom,duty-us: duty cycle for pwm in micro secs


Example:
		qcom,vib@c000 {
			status = "okay";
			compatible = "qcom,qpnp-vibrator";
			reg = <0xc000 0x100>;
			label = "vibrator";
			qcom,vib-timeout-ms = <15000>;
			qcom,vib-vtg-level-mV = <3100>;
			qcom,mode = "dtest3";
			qcom,pwm-channel = <5>;
			qcom,period-us = <1000>;
			qcom,duty-us = <750>;
			qcom,active-low;
		};
