	  CPU idle is a generic framework for supporting software-controlled
	  idle processor power management.  It includes modular cross-platform
	  governors that can be swapped during runtime.

	  If you're using an ACPI-enabled platform, you should say Y here.

          MTK governor is used for MTK SoCs to select the correct idle state,
          which applies system scenario-based policy.
          MTK governor is specified for MTK SoCs.
          MTK CPUidle drivers should be paired with MTK governer.

config CPU_IDLE_GOV_MTK_MENU
        bool "MTK menu governor (for MediaTek SoCs)"
        help
          MTK menu governor is based on upstream menu governor,
          and modify predict_us policy to fit
          execution characteristics of MTK SoCs.
          MTK menu can be substituted for upstream menu governor
