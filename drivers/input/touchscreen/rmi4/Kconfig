config RMI4_DEBUG
	bool "RMI4 Debugging"
	depends on RMI4_CORE
	select DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Say Y here to enable debug feature in the RMI4 driver.

	  Note that the RMI4 driver debug features can generate a lot of
	  output (potentially clogging up your dmesg output) and generally
	  slow down driver operation.  It's recommended to enable them only
	  if you are actively developing/debugging RMI4 features.

	  If unsure, say N.

config RMI4_FWLIB
	bool "RMI4 Firmware Update"
	depends on RMI4_CORE

	depends on RMI4_CORE && I2C
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support RMI4 devices connected to an I2C

	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 1A.

	  Function 1A provides self testing for touchscreens and touchpads.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f1a.

	tristate "RMI4 Function 09 (self testing)"
	depends on RMI4_CORE
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 09.

	tristate "RMI4 Function 11 (2D pointing)"
	depends on RMI4_CORE
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 11.

	  Function 11 provides 2D multifinger pointing for touchscreens and
	  touchpads.  For sensors that support relative pointing, F11 also
	  provides mouse input.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f11.

config RMI4_F11_PEN
	bool "RMI4 F11 Pen Support"
	depends on RMI4_F11
	help
	  Say Y here to add support for pen input to RMI4 function 11.

	  If this feature is enabled, when pen inputs are detected they
	  will be reported to the input stream as MT_TOOL_PEN.  Otherwise,
	  pens will be treated the same as fingers.

	  Not all UI implementations deal gracefully with pen discrimination.
	  If your system is not recognizing pen touches and you know your
	  sensor supports pen input, you probably want to turn this feature
	  off.

config RMI4_VIRTUAL_BUTTON
	tristate "RMI4 Vitual Button"
	depends on RMI4_F11
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 virtual button to F11.
