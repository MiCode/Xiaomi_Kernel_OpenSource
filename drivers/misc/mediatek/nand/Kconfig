menuconfig MTK_MTD_NAND
	tristate "MediaTek Nand Support"
	depends on MTD_NAND
	help
	  NAND flash memory, a type of non-volatile storage device,
	  introduced by Toshiba in 1989. With formal commands,
	  controller can access data via devices.
	  This configuration enable Mediatek NAND controller to perform operations
	  on NAND devices of verious vendors.
	  For products choosing raw NAND as booting device,this configuration must say y.
	  Since kernel using MTD as storage device common driver,
	  this configuration depends on MTD_NAND config.
	  Please visit JEDEC sites for more information.

config MTK_MTD_NAND_INTERRUPT_SCHEME
	bool "Nand Read/Write with interrupt scheme"
	depends on MTK_MTD_NAND
	default n
	help
	  While performing page read/write to NAND device, controller use
	  DMA to send/receive data to/from device. There are two schemes to
	  wait until DMA finish its' job, polling and interrupt.
	  Using polling may quicker, but CPU resource won't be released.
	  Interrupt may suffer some software overhead, but CPU can be released.
	  This configuration is for user to chose from these two scheme.
	  Default using polling mode since DMA may not take too long.

config MTK_TLC_NAND_SUPPORT
	tristate "Mediatek MLC NAND Support"
	depends on MTK_MTD_NAND
	help
	  In electronics, TLC is a memory element capable of
	  storing more than a single bit of information.
	  TLC NAND flash is a flash memory technology using multiple levels per
	  cell to allow more bits to be stored using the same number of transistors.
	  The primary benefit of TLC flash memory is its lower cost per unit of storage
	  due to the higher data density, and memory-reading software can compensate for
	  a larger bit error rate.
	  Thus, firmware and driver to support TLC devices need to take care of data robustness,
	  and TLC features with extend command and storage methods.
	  Compatible with SLC, MLC and TLC, Mediatek controller driver and firmware have
	  implement various method to enhance data robustness.
	  While using TLC devices as booting device, please set this configuration as
	  y to enable TLC features.

config MTK_MLC_NAND_SUPPORT
	tristate "Mediatek MLC NAND Support"
	depends on MTK_MTD_NAND
	help
	  In electronics, a multi-level cell (MLC) is a memory element capable of
	  storing more than a single bit of information.
	  MLC NAND flash is a flash memory technology using multiple levels per
	  cell to allow more bits to be stored using the same number of transistors.
	  The primary benefit of MLC flash memory is its lower cost per unit of storage
	  due to the higher data density, and memory-reading software can compensate for
	  a larger bit error rate.
	  Thus, firmware and driver to support MLC devices need to take care of data robustness,
	  and MLC features with extend command and storage methods.
	  Compatible with both SLC and MLC, Mediatek controller driver and firmware have
	  implement various method to enhance data robustness.
	  While using MLC devices as booting device, please set this configuration as
	  y to enable MLC features.

config MTK_NAND_BITFLIP
	tristate "Mediatek NAND Bit flip injection"
	depends on MTK_MTD_NAND
	help
	  The upper layer will do re-charge When bit flip is happened
	  Inject bitflip will simulate  the worst case of NAND device
	  It will trigger more GC/re-charge for stress testing
	  This option is for testing only

config MTK_COMBO_NAND_SUPPORT
	tristate "Mediatek COMBO NAND Support"
	depends on MTK_MTD_NAND
	help
	  NAND memories are accessed much like block devices.
	  Each block consists of a number of pages.
	  Knowned that reading and programming is performed on a page basis,
	  and erasure can only be performed on a block basis.
	  Different devices have different block size and page size.
	  This configuration enables the multi devices in one load feature.

config MTK_FAT_ON_NAND
	tristate "Mediatek FAT on NAND Support"
	depends on MTK_MTD_NAND
	help
	  Enable FAT on nand feature of Mediatek NAND driver.
	  This will create a FAT partition on NAND device.
	  With this configuration turns on, user can use UMS to access native storage.
	  Without this configuration, users only use MTP to acces native storage.
	  Please see Project config for more information of this configuration.

config MTK_FACTORY_RESET_PROTECTION_SUPPORT
	bool "Mediatek FRP Support"
	depends on MTK_MTD_NAND
	help
	  FRP stands for factory reset protect.
	  This feature backup customer data after factory reset.
	  Turn on this configuration to enable data save after factory reset.

config MTK_NAND_V2
	bool "Mediatek NAND Driver Version 2 Support"
	depends on MTK_MTD_NAND
	help
	  Enable mtk nand driver version 2.
