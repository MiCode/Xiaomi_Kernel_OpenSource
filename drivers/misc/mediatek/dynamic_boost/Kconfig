	bool "Enable a boost interface"
        default n
        help
	  Provide an interface to boost cpu hotplug and dvfs for performance
	  improvement. This is target to kernel modules by event. The boost
	  can support both one-time event and continuous boost. It can cover
	  both HMP and SMP platform.

config TOUCH_BOOST
        bool "Enable touch boost"
        depends on MTK_DYNAMIC_BOOST
        default n
        help
	  This option enables touch boost. It is implemented by registering an
	  input event handler. Once dynamic_boost driver receives an input event,
	  it will hotplug on 2 LITTLE cores and set max frequency. Touch boost is
	  a one-time boost mechanism.

config SCREEN_ON_BOOST
	bool "Enable screen on boost"
	depends on MTK_DYNAMIC_BOOST
	default n
	help
	  This option enables screen on boost. It will register the lcm
	  brightness notifier, and identify the event, FB_BLANK_UNBLANK, as lcm on.
	  It will set at least 2 cores online for 200ms.
