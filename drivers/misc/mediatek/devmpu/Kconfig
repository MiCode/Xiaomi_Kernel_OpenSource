config MTK_DEVMPU
	bool "Enable MTK Device MPU driver"
	help
	  Device MPU is a kernel driver providing
	  non-continuous memory protection in the
	  2MB granularity. Note that the protection
	  is conducted in parallel with EMI MPU.

config MTK_DEVMPU_EMI
	bool "Enable MTK Device MPU with EMI MPU"
	select MTK_DEVMPU
	help
	  Device MPU hardware will receive the violation
	  from EMI MPU hardware. Device MPU driver will
	  receive violation via call-back function of
	  EMI MPU.

config MTK_DEVMPU_AEE
	bool "Enable aee_kernel_exception for Device MPU violation"
	depends on MTK_DEVMPU
	help
	  Say yes here to enable aee_kernel_exception. When Device
	  MPU violation occur, Device MPU driver will call
	  aee_kernel_exception, and we will get kernelAPI dump
	  DB for analyze.

config MTK_DEVMPU_SLOG
	bool "Enable slog for Device MPU violation"
	depends on MTK_DEVMPU
	help
	  Say yes here to enable mtk slog. When Device
	  MPU violation occur, Device MPU driver will dump
	  violation info to slog, then slog system record
	  it and list as issue when offline parsing.

	  Say yes here to enable support Mediatek MT6781
	  Device MPU driver. This driver is only for
	  Device MPU feature in MT6781 platfom without
	  EMI.

config DEVMPU_MT6833

	  Device MPU feature in MT6833 platfom without
	  EMI.

config DEVMPU_MT6853
	bool "Mediatek MT6853 Device MPU driver"
	depends on MACH_MT6853
	select MTK_DEVMPU
	help
	  Say yes here to enable support Mediatek MT6853
	  Device MPU driver. This driver is combined with
	  ACP features of Device MPU in MT6853 platfom
	  without EMI.

config DEVMPU_MT6873
	bool "Mediatek MT6873 Device MPU driver"
	depends on MACH_MT6873
	select MTK_DEVMPU
	help
	  Say yes here to enable support Mediatek MT6873
	  Device MPU driver. This driver is combined with
	  ACP and EMI features of Device MPU in MT6873
	  platfom.

config DEVMPU_MT6877
