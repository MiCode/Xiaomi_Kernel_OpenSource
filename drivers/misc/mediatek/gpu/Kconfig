config MTK_GPU_SUPPORT
	bool "Support MTK GPU"
	default n
	help
	  config supports MTK GPU driver.
	  CONFIG_MTK_GPU_SUPPORT defines
	  if the gpu driver should be built in or not

config MTK_GPU_VERSION
	string "Support MTK GPU Driver Version"
	default ""
	help
	  CONFIG_MTK_GPU_VERSION define which gpu ddk version will be used
	  It has three parts
	  1.vendor name 2.GPU architecture name 3. driver version

config MTK_GPU_COMMON_DVFS_SUPPORT
	bool "Support GPU VSync-Based DVFS Policy"
	default n
	help
	  config supports to enable GPU DVFS policy.
	  It is nice method to save power.
	  It is recommended to enable it when MTK_GPU_SUPPORT is enabled.

config MTK_GPU_OPP_STATS_SUPPORT
	bool "Support GPU opp stat"
	depends on MTK_GPU_COMMON_DVFS_SUPPORT
	default y
	help
	  This config supports to enable opp stat during DVFS.
	  This also provides to track DevFreq like in debugFS and add
	  idle stats at runtime. Provides API set that can query in
	  other kernel modules.

config MTK_GPU_R5P0
	bool "Force to use r5p0 driver"
	default n
	help

	bool "Enable SW 64bit sync counter"
	depends on SW_SYNC
	help
	  A sync object driver that uses a 64bit counter to coordinate
	  syncrhronization.  Useful when there is no hardware primitive backing
	  the synchronization.

config MTK_GPU_SPM_DVFS_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable GPU SPM DVFS"
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to enable a dedicated HW to do GPU DVFS.
	  The feature is still under experiment. Enable only if you know
	  what your are doing.
	  MTK_GPU_COMMON_DVFS_SUPPORT and MTK_GPU_SPM_DVFS_SUPPORT shouldn't
	  exist concurrently.

config MTK_GPU_SWPM_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable GPU SPM DVFS"
	default n
	help
	   config supports to make SWPM enable/disable GPU power model
