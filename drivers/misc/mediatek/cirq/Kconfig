	bool
	help
	  System interrupt controller(SYS_CIRQ) is a low-power interrupt controller
	  which is designed to work outside MCUSYS as second level interrupt controller.
	  With SYS_CIRQ, the MCUSYS can be completely turned off
	  to improve system power consumption without losing interrupts.

config FAST_CIRQ_CLONE_FLUSH
	def_bool n
	depends on MTK_SYS_CIRQ
	help
	  Legacy CIRQ driver clone and flush IRQ pol/sen/pending very slow, since
	  it checks every IRQ to decide if it should clone or not. This config speed up the process
	  by only clone once when the sysetm first enter low power mode and only setup
	  cirq IDs for wakeup source.
