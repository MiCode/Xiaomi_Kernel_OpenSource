menuconfig CORESIGHT
	bool "CoreSight Tracing Support"
	help
	  CoreSight components are compliant with the ARM CoreSight
	  architecture specification and can be connected in various
	  topologies to suite a particular SoCs tracing needs. These trace
	  components can generally be classified as sources, links and
	  sinks. Trace data produced by one or more sources flows through
	  the intermediate links connecting the source to the currently
	  selected sink.

	  This framework provides an interface for the CoreSight debug and
	  trace drivers to register themselves with. It's intended to build
	  up a topological view of the CoreSight components and configure
	  the right series of components on user input via sysfs. It also
	  provides status information to user space applications through
	  sysfs interface.

	  If unsure, say 'N' here to avoid potential power, performance and
	  memory penalty.

config CORESIGHT_EVENT
	tristate "CoreSight Event driver"
	help

	  and performing CoreSight actions like aborting trace on their
	  occurrence. These events can be controlled by using module
	  parameters.

	bool

config CORESIGHT_FUSE
	bool "CoreSight Fuse driver"
	help
	  This driver provides support for CoreSight Fuse state checks that
	  other CoreSight drivers can query to determine existence of
	  Hardware functionality they support. Drivers can then take necessary
	  actions like failing the probe if the Hardware they manage is
	  functionally disabled.

config CORESIGHT_CTI
	bool "CoreSight Cross Trigger Interface driver"
	help
	  This driver provides support for Cross Trigger Interface that is
	  used to input or output i.e. pass cross trigger events from one
	  hardware component to another. It can also be used to pass
	  software generated events.

config CORESIGHT_CTI_SAVE_DISABLE
	bool "Turn off CTI save and restore"
	help
	  Turns off CoreSight CTI save and restore support for cpu CTIs. This
	  avoids voting for the clocks during probe as well as the associated
	  save and restore latency at the cost of breaking cpu CTI support on
	  targets where cpu CTIs have to be preserved across power collapse.

	  If unsure, say 'N' here to avoid breaking cpu CTI support.

	help
	  This driver provides support for Trace Memory Controller which
	  can be configured as either an ETB (Embedded Trace Buffer),
	  ETR (Embedded Trace Router) or ETF (Embedded Trace Fifo). It acts
	  as sink when configured as ETB, ETR or ETF in circular buffer mode
	  whereas it is a link when configured as ETF in hardware fifo mode.

	  ETB collects trace data in a circular buffer whereas ETR can be
	  used to route trace data to memory allocated in RAM. ETF in
	  circular buffer mode is like an ETB whereas in hardware fifo mode
	  it is a fifo link.

config CORESIGHT_REPLICATOR
	bool "CoreSight Replicator driver"
	help
