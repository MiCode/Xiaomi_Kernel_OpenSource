config SENSORS_ISL29018
	tristate "ISL 29018 light and proximity sensor"
	depends on I2C
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for ambient light sensing and
	  proximity infrared sensing from Intersil ISL29018.
	  This driver will provide the measurements of ambient light intensity
	  in lux, proximity infrared sensing and normal infrared sensing.
	  Data from sensor is accessible via sysfs.

config SENSORS_ISL29028
	tristate "ISL 29028/ISL 29029 light and proximity sensor"
	depends on I2C
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for ambient light sensing and
	  proximity ir sensing from intersil ISL29028/ISL29029.
	  This driver will provide the measurements of ambient light intensity
	  in lux, proximity infrared sensing and normal infrared sensing.
	  Data from sensor is accessible via sysfs.

config SENSORS_TSL2563
	tristate "TAOS TSL2560, TSL2561, TSL2562 and TSL2563 ambient light sensors"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 If you say yes here you get support for the Taos TSL2560,
	 TSL2561, TSL2562 and TSL2563 ambient light sensors.

	 This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	 will be called tsl2563.

config TSL2583
	tristate "TAOS TSL2580, TSL2581 and TSL2583 light-to-digital converters"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 Provides support for the TAOS tsl2580, tsl2581 and tsl2583 devices.
	 Access ALS data via iio, sysfs.

config SENSORS_LTR558
	tristate "LTR558 Ambient light and proximity sensor"
	depends on I2C
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for ambient light sensing and
	  proximity ir sensing from Lite On Technology LTR558.

config SENSORS_CM3217
	tristate "CM3217 light sensor"
	depends on I2C
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the CM3217 Ambient Light Sensor.
