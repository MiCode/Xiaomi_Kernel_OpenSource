config SENSORS_LTR558
	tristate "LTR558 Ambient light and proximity sensor"
	depends on I2C
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for ambient light sensing and
	  proximity ir sensing from Lite On Technology LTR558.

config SENSORS_MAX44005
	tristate "MAX44005 ALS, RGB, temperature, IR, proximity Sensor"
	depends on I2C
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for ambient light, RGB, IR,
	  Proximity and temperature sensing from MAX44005.

config SENSORS_STM8T143
	tristate "STM8T143 proximity sensor"
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for ST Microelectronics
	  STM8T143 sensor driver.
	  The STM8T143 sensor driver provices suport for proximity sensing.
	  Data from sensor is accessible via sysfs.

config SENSORS_TCS3772
	tristate "TCS3772 Ambient light, RGB and proximity Sensor"
	depends on I2C
	select REGMAP_I2C
	default n
	help

config SENSORS_CM3217
	tristate "CM3217 Ambient light sensor"
	depends on I2C
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the CM3217 Ambient Light Sensor.

config LS_OF
	tristate "Device Tree parsing for Light sensor specification details"
	depends on OF
	default n
	help
	  Say Y for helpers to retrieve the sensor specification details like
	  vendor, power consumed, max range, resolution and integration.
	  This information is common to most Ambient light sensors as well as
	  proximity sensors. Hence, have common callbacks to retrive this
	  information from the respective device tree nodes.

config LS_SYSFS
	tristate "IIO registration for sensor meta data"
	depends on LS_OF
