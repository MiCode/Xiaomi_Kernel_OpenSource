	  This driver provides support for coresight debugging module. This
	  is primarily used to dump sample-based profiling registers when
	  system triggers panic, the driver will parse context registers so
	  can quickly get to know program counter (PC), secure state,
	  exception level, etc. Before use debugging functionality, platform
	  needs to ensure the clock domain and power domain are enabled
	  properly, please refer Documentation/trace/coresight-cpu-debug.txt
	  for detailed description and the example for usage.

config CORESIGHT_CTI
