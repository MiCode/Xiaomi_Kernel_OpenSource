menuconfig CORESIGHT
	bool "CoreSight Tracing Support"
	select ARM_AMBA
	help
	  This framework provides a kernel interface for the CoreSight debug
	  and trace drivers to register themselves with. It's intended to build
	  a topological view of the CoreSight components based on a DT
	  specification and configure the right serie of components when a
	  trace source gets enabled.

config CORESIGHT_EVENT
        tristate "CoreSight Event driver"
        help
          This driver provides support for registering with various events
          and performing CoreSight actions like aborting trace on their
          occurrence. These events can be controlled by using module
          parameters.

config CORESIGHT_CSR
	bool "CoreSight Slave Register driver"
	help
	  This driver provides support for CoreSight Slave Register block
	  that hosts miscellaneous configuration registers.
	  Those configuration registers can be used to control, various
	  coresight configurations.

config CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	bool "CoreSight Link and Sink drivers"
	help
	  This enables support for CoreSight link and sink drivers that are
	  responsible for transporting and collecting the trace data
	  respectively.  Link and sinks are dynamically aggregated with a trace
	  entity at run time to form a complete trace path.

config CORESIGHT_LINK_AND_SINK_TMC
	bool "Coresight generic TMC driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	select CORESIGHT_CSR
	help
	  This enables support for the Trace Memory Controller driver.
	  Depending on its configuration the device can act as a link (embedded
	  trace router - ETR) or sink (embedded trace FIFO).  The driver
	  complies with the generic implementation of the component without
	  special enhancement or added features.

config CORESIGHT_SINK_TPIU
	bool "Coresight generic TPIU driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This enables support for the Trace Port Interface Unit driver,
	  responsible for bridging the gap between the on-chip coresight
	  components and a trace for bridging the gap between the on-chip
	  coresight components and a trace port collection engine, typically
	  connected to an external host for use case capturing more traces than
	  the on-board coresight memory can handle.

config CORESIGHT_SINK_ETBV10
	bool "Coresight ETBv1.0 driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This enables support for the Embedded Trace Buffer version 1.0 driver
	  that complies with the generic implementation of the component without
	  special enhancement or added features.

config CORESIGHT_SOURCE_ETM3X
	bool "CoreSight Embedded Trace Macrocell 3.x driver"
	depends on !ARM64
	select CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This driver provides support for processor ETM3.x and PTM1.x modules,
	  which allows tracing the instructions that a processor is executing
	  This is primarily useful for instruction level tracing.  Depending
	  the ETM version data tracing may also be available.

config CORESIGHT_SOURCE_ETM4X
	bool "CoreSight Embedded Trace Macrocell 4.x driver"
	select CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This driver provides support for the ETM4.x tracer module, tracing the
	  instructions that a processor is executing. This is primarily useful
	  for instruction level tracing. Depending on the implemented version
	  data tracing may also be available.

config CORESIGHT_REMOTE_ETM
	bool "Remote processor ETM trace support"
	depends on MSM_QMI_INTERFACE
	help
	  Enables support for ETM trace collection on remote processor using
	  CoreSight framework. Enabling this will allow turning on ETM
	  tracing on remote processor via sysfs by configuring the required
	  CoreSight components.

config CORESIGHT_REMOTE_ETM_DEFAULT_ENABLE
	int "default enable bits for Remote processor ETM"
	depends on CORESIGHT_REMOTE_ETM
	help
	  Support for enabling separated Remote processor ETM tracing. Depends
	  on if instance id bit is set.

config CORESIGHT_QCOM_REPLICATOR
	bool "Qualcomm CoreSight Replicator driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This enables support for Qualcomm CoreSight link driver. The
	  programmable ATB replicator sends the ATB trace stream from the
	  ETB/ETF to the TPIUi and ETR.

config CORESIGHT_STM
	bool "CoreSight System Trace Macrocell driver"
	select CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This driver provides support for hardware assisted software
	  instrumentation based tracing. This is primarily useful for
	  logging useful software events or data.

config CORESIGHT_HWEVENT
	bool "CoreSight Hardware Event driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_STM
	select CORESIGHT_CSR
	help
	  This driver provides support for monitoring and tracing CoreSight
	  Hardware Event across STM interface. It configures Coresight
	  Hardware Event mux control registers to select hardware events
	  based on user input.

config CORESIGHT_CTI
	bool "CoreSight Cross Trigger Interface driver"
	help
	  This driver provides support for Cross Trigger Interface that is
	  used to input or output i.e. pass cross trigger events from one
	  hardware component to another. It can also be used to pass
	  software generated events.

config CORESIGHT_CTI_SAVE_DISABLE
	bool "Turn off CTI save and restore"
	depends on CORESIGHT_CTI
	help
	  Turns off CoreSight CTI save and restore support for cpu CTIs. This
	  avoids voting for the clocks during probe as well as the associated
	  save and restore latency at the cost of breaking cpu CTI support on
	  targets where cpu CTIs have to be preserved across power collapse.

	  If unsure, say 'N' here to avoid breaking cpu CTI support.

config CORESIGHT_TPDA
	bool "CoreSight Trace, Profiling & Diagnostics Aggregator driver"
	help
	  This driver provides support for configuring aggregator. This is
	  primarily useful for pulling the data sets from one or more
	  attached monitors and pushing the resultant data out. Multiple
	  monitors are connected on different input ports of TPDA.

config CORESIGHT_TPDM
	bool "CoreSight Trace, Profiling & Diagnostics Monitor driver"
	help
	  This driver provides support for configuring monitor. Monitors are
	  primarily responsible for data set collection and support the
	  ability to collect any permutation of data set types. Monitors are
	  also responsible for interaction with system cross triggering.

config CORESIGHT_TPDM_DEFAULT_ENABLE
	bool "Turn on TPDM tracing by default"
	depends on CORESIGHT_TPDM
	help
	  Turns on CoreSight TPDM tracing for different data set types by
	  default. Otherwise, tracing is disabled by default but can be
	  enabled via sysfs.

	  If unsure, say 'N' here to avoid potential power and performance
	  penalty.

config CORESIGHT_QPDI
	bool "CoreSight PMIC debug interface support"
	help
	  This driver provides support for controlling the PMIC debug interface
	  feature. When enabled via sysfs it allows disagnostic access to the
	  PMIC. Similarly this debug feature can be disabled via sysfs which
	  prevents debug dongle detection.

config CORESIGHT_SOURCE_DUMMY
	bool "Dummy source support"
	help
	  Enables support for dummy source devices. Dummy source driver can be
	  used for CoreSight sources that are owned and configured by some other
	  subsystem and use Linux drivers to configure rest of trace path.
