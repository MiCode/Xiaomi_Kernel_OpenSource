config QPNP_FG
	tristate "QPNP fuel gauge driver"
	depends on MFD_SPMI_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the Fuel Gauge driver. This adds support for
	  battery fuel gauging and state of charge of battery connected to the
	  fuel gauge. The state of charge is reported through a BMS power
	  supply property and also sends uevents when the capacity is updated.

config QPNP_FG_GEN3
	tristate "QPNP GEN3 fuel gauge driver"
	depends on MFD_SPMI_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the GEN3 Fuel Gauge driver. This adds support
	  for battery fuel gauging and state of charge of battery connected to
	  the fuel gauge. The state of charge is reported through a BMS power
	  supply property and also sends uevents when the capacity is updated.

config SMB135X_CHARGER
	tristate "SMB135X Battery Charger"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  Say Y to include support for SMB135X Battery Charger.
	  SMB135X is a dual path switching mode charger capable of charging
	  the battery with 3Amps of current.
	  The driver supports charger enable/disable.
	  The driver reports the charger status via the power supply framework.
	  A charger status change triggers an IRQ via the device STAT pin.

config SMB1355_SLAVE_CHARGER
	tristate "SMB1355 Slave Battery Charger"
	depends on MFD_I2C_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y to include support for SMB1355 Battery Charger.
	  SMB1355 is a single phase 5A battery charger.
	  The driver supports charger enable/disable.
	  The driver reports the charger status via the power supply framework.
	  A charger status change triggers an IRQ via the device STAT pin.

config SMB1351_USB_CHARGER
	tristate "smb1351 usb charger (with VBUS detection)"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 Say Y to enable support for the SMB1351 switching mode based charger.
	 The driver supports charging control (enable/disable) and
	 charge-current limiting. It also provides USB VBUS detection and
	 notification support. The driver controls SMB1351 via I2C and
	 supports device-tree interface.

config QPNP_SMB2
	tristate "SMB2 Battery Charger"
	depends on MFD_SPMI_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y to enables support for the SMB2 charging peripheral.
	  The QPNP SMB2 charger driver supports the charger peripheral
	  present in the PMICOBALT chip.
	  The power supply framework is used to communicate battery and
	  usb properties to userspace and other driver consumers such
	  as fuel gauge, USB, and USB-PD.
	  VBUS and VCONN regulators are registered for supporting OTG,
	  and powered Type-C cables respectively.

config SMB138X_CHARGER
	tristate "SMB138X Battery Charger"
	depends on MFD_I2C_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y to include support for SMB138X Battery Charger.
	  SMB1380 is a dual phase 6A battery charger, and SMB1381 is a single
	  phase 5A battery charger.
	  The driver supports charger enable/disable.
	  The driver reports the charger status via the power supply framework.
	  A charger status change triggers an IRQ via the device STAT pin.

config QPNP_SMBCHARGER
	tristate "QPNP SMB Charger driver"
	depends on MFD_SPMI_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the dual path switch mode battery charger which
	  supports USB detection and battery charging up to 3A.
	  The driver also offers relevant information to userspace via the
	  power supply framework.

config QPNP_QNOVO
	bool "QPNP QNOVO driver"
	depends on MFD_SPMI_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the Qnovo pulse charging engine. Qnovo driver
	  accepts pulse parameters via sysfs entries and programs the hardware
	  module. It also allows userspace code to read diagnostics of voltage
	  and current measured during certain phases of the pulses.
