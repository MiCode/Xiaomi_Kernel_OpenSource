config SPS
	tristate "SPS support"
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	help
	  The SPS (Smart Peripheral Switch) is a DMA engine.
	  It can move data in the following modes:
		1. Peripheral-to-Peripheral.
		2. Peripheral-to-Memory.
		3. Memory-to-Memory.

config SPS_SUPPORT_BAMDMA
	bool "SPS supports BAM DMA"
	depends on SPS
	help
	  The BAM-DMA is used for Memory-to-Memory transfers.
	  The main use cases is RPC between processors.
	  The BAM-DMA hardware has 2 registers sets:
		1. A BAM HW like all the peripherals.
		2. A DMA channel configuration (i.e. channel priority).

config SPS_SUPPORT_NDP_BAM
	bool "SPS supports NDP BAM"
	depends on SPS
	help
	  No-Data-Path BAM is used to improve BAM performance.
	  NDP BAMs enables peripherals with fast fabric connectivity
	  to do the actual data transfer themselves, instead of the
	  BAM.

config EP_PCIE
	tristate "PCIe Endpoint mode support"
	depends on QCOM_PCI_EDMA
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	help
	  PCIe controller is in endpoint mode.
	  It supports the APIs to clients as a service layer, and allows
	  clients to enable/disable PCIe link, configure the address
	  mapping for the access to host memory, trigger wake interrupt
	  on host side to wake up host, and trigger MSI to host side.

config MSM_MHI_DEV
        tristate "Modem Device Interface Driver"
	depends on EP_PCIE
        help
          This kernel module is used to interact with PCIe Root complex
          supporting MHI protocol. MHI is a data transmission protocol
          involving communication between a host and a device over shared
          memory. MHI interacts with the IPA for supporting transfers
	  on the HW accelerated channels between Host and device.

config MSM_MHI_NET_DEV
        tristate "Modem Device Interface Driver"
	depends on EP_PCIE
        help
          This kernel module enables communication over a MHI channel for
	  clients by creating a network device. This module interacts
	  with the MHI device driver to send and receive data to/from a
	  host.

config IPA3
	tristate "IPA3 support"
	depends on NET
	help
	  This framework supports the Internet Packet Accelerator (IPA3) core.
	  IPA is a programmable protocol processor HW block.
	  It is designed to support generic HW processing of UL/DL IP packets
	  for various use cases independent of radio technology.
	  The driver support client connection and configuration
	  for the IPA core.
	  Kernel and user-space processes can call the IPA driver
	  to configure IPA core.

config IPA_WDI_UNIFIED_API
	bool "IPA WDI unified API support"
	depends on IPA3
	help
	  This driver supports IPA WDI unified API.
	  WDI is the interface between IPA micro controller and WLAN chipset.
	  It is designed to support IPA HW accelerating path for WLAN use case.
	  The IPA WDI unified API supports all WDI versions through a unified
	  interface.

config USB_BAM
	tristate "USB BAM Driver"
	depends on SPS && USB_GADGET
	help
	  Enabling this option adds USB BAM Driver.
	  USB BAM driver was added to supports Smart Peripheral Subsystem
	  Peripheral-to-Peripheral transfers between the USB and other
	  peripheral.

config MSM_GENI_SE
	tristate "QCOM GENI Serial Engine Driver"
	help
	  This module is used to interact with GENI based Serial Engines on
	  Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Universal Peripheral(QUPv3). This
	  module is used to configure and read the configuration from the
	  Serial Engines.

config QPNP_REVID
	tristate "QPNP Revision ID Peripheral"
	depends on SPMI
	help
	  Say 'y' here to include support for the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
	  QPNP REVID peripheral. REVID prints out the PMIC type and revision
	  numbers in the kernel log along with the PMIC option status. The PMIC
	  type is mapped to a QTI chip part number and logged as well.

config MSM_11AD
	tristate "Platform driver for 11ad chip"
	depends on PCI
	depends on PCI_MSM
	help
	  This module adds required platform support for wireless adapter based on
	  Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. 11ad chip, integrated into MSM platform

	  If you choose to build it as a module, it will be called
	  msm_11ad_proxy.
