config MSM_SSBI
	bool "Qualcomm Single-wire Serial Bus Interface (SSBI)"
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  built-in SSBI interface on Qualcomm MSM family processors.

	  This is required for communicating with Qualcomm PMICs and
	  other devices that have the SSBI interface.

	  The SPS (Smart Peripheral Switch) is a DMA engine.
	  It can move data in the following modes:
		1. Peripheral-to-Peripheral.
		2. Peripheral-to-Memory.
		3. Memory-to-Memory.

config USB_BAM
	boolean "USB BAM Driver"
	depends on SPS && USB_GADGET
	help
	  Enabling this option adds USB BAM Driver.
	  USB BAM driver was added to supports SPS Peripheral-to-Peripheral
	  transfers between the USB and other peripheral.

config SPS_SUPPORT_BAMDMA
	bool "SPS support BAM DMA"
	depends on SPS
	default n
	help
	  The BAM-DMA is used for Memory-to-Memory transfers.
	  The main use cases is RPC between processors.
	  The BAM-DMA hardware has 2 registers sets:
		1. A BAM HW like all the peripherals.
		2. A DMA channel configuration (i.e. channel priority).

        help
          This driver supports PWM/LPG devices in Qualcomm PMIC chips which
          comply with QPNP.  QPNP is a SPMI based PMIC implementation.  These
          devices support Pulse Width Modulation output with user generated
          patterns. They share a lookup table with size of 64 entries.

config QPNP_POWER_ON
	tristate "QPNP PMIC POWER-ON Driver"
	depends on OF_SPMI && SPMI && MSM_QPNP_INT
	help
	  This driver supports the power-on functionality on Qualcomm
	  PNP PMIC. It currently supports reporting the change in status of
	  the KPDPWR_N line (connected to the power-key).

config QPNP_CLKDIV
	tristate "QPNP PMIC clkdiv driver"
	depends on OF_SPMI && SPMI
	help
	  This driver supports the clkdiv functionality on the Qualcomm
	  PNP PMIC. It configures the frequency of clkdiv outputs on the
	  PMIC. These clocks are typically wired through alternate functions
	  on gpio pins.
