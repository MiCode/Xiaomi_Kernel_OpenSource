	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	help
	  PCIe controller is in endpoint mode.
	  It supports the APIs to clients as a service layer, and allows
	  clients to enable/disable PCIe link, configure the address
	  mapping for the access to host memory, trigger wake interrupt
	  on host side to wake up host, and trigger MSI to host side.

	depends on EP_PCIE && IPA3
        help
          This kernel module is used to interact with PCIe Root complex
          supporting MHI protocol. MHI is a data transmission protocol
          involving communication between a host and a device over shared
          memory. MHI interacts with the IPA for supporting transfers
	  on the HW accelerated channels between Host and device.

config IPA3
	tristate "IPA3 support"
	depends on NET
	help
	  This framework supports the Internet Packet Accelerator (IPA3) core.
	  IPA is a programmable protocol processor HW block.
	  It is designed to support generic HW processing of UL/DL IP packets
	  for various use cases independent of radio technology.
	  The driver support client connection and configuration
	  for the IPA core.
	  Kernel and user-space processes can call the IPA driver
	  to configure IPA core.

config IPA_WDI_UNIFIED_API
	bool "IPA WDI unified API support"
	depends on IPA3
	help
	  This driver supports IPA WDI unified API.
	  WDI is the interface between IPA micro controller and WLAN chipset.
	  It is designed to support IPA HW accelerating path for WLAN use case.
	  The IPA WDI unified API supports all WDI versions through a unified
	  interface.

config USB_BAM
	tristate "USB BAM Driver"
	depends on SPS && USB_GADGET
	help
	  Enabling this option adds USB BAM Driver.
	  USB BAM driver was added to supports Smart Peripheral Subsystem
	  Peripheral-to-Peripheral transfers between the USB and other
	  peripheral.

config MSM_GENI_SE
	tristate "QCOM GENI Serial Engine Driver"
	help
	  This module is used to interact with GENI based Serial Engines on
	  Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Universal Peripheral(QUPv3). This
	  module is used to configure and read the configuration from the
	  Serial Engines.

config QPNP_REVID
	tristate "QPNP Revision ID Peripheral"
	depends on SPMI
	help
	  Say 'y' here to include support for the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
	  QPNP REVID peripheral. REVID prints out the PMIC type and revision
	  numbers in the kernel log along with the PMIC option status. The PMIC
	  type is mapped to a QTI chip part number and logged as well.

config MSM_11AD
	tristate "Platform driver for 11ad chip"
	depends on PCI
	depends on PCI_MSM
	help
	  This module adds required platform support for wireless adapter based on
	  Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. 11ad chip, integrated into MSM platform

	  If you choose to build it as a module, it will be called
	  msm_11ad_proxy.

config R8125
	tristate "Realtek R8125 driver"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  This is a 2.5Gbps ethernet driver for the PCI network cards based on
	  the Realtek 8125B chip. If you have one of those, say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called r8125.

config R8125_IPA_OFFLOAD
	bool "Enable IPA offload on Realtek R8125 driver"
	depends on IPA3
	help
	  Enables IPA Ethernet Offload path on Realtek R8125 driver. It is
	  designed to support generic HW processing of UL/DL IP packets for
	  various use cases independent of radio technology. When this is
	  disabled Realtek R8125 driver switches to embedded software path.

config IPA_ETH
	bool "IPA Ethernet Offload Sub-system support"
	depends on IPA3
	help
	  Enables IPA Ethernet Offload Subsystem for offloading PCI based
	  ethernet devices to IPA. The offload subsystem still require a
	  compatible network driver to register with it and a corresponding
	  offload driver to manage one of more offload data paths that uses
	  the network device.

config IPA_ETH_NOAUTO
	bool "Disable automatic offload initialization of interfaces"
	depends on IPA_ETH
	help
	  Enabling this option prevents automatic initialization of offload on
	  ethernet interfaces. Debugfs control interface will instead be used
	  to enable offloading. This feature is meant only for debugging.
	  If unsure, say N.

config IPA_ETH_DEBUG
	bool "Enable addtional debug logging in the offload sub-system"
	depends on IPA_ETH
	help
	  Enabling this option increases the number of messages logged by the offload
	  sub-system for aiding debugging. Additional debug messages are logged into
	  IPC log as well as kernel log using dynamic debug.
	  If unsure, say N.
