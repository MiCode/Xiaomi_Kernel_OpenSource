	select MAILBOX
	select MTK_CMDQ_MBOX
	select MTK_INFRACFG
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek Command Queue (CMDQ)
	  driver. The CMDQ is used to help read/write registers with critical
	  time limitation, such as updating display configuration during the
	  vblank.

config MTK_INFRACFG
	bool "MediaTek INFRACFG Support"
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek INFRACFG controller. The
	  INFRACFG controller contains various infrastructure registers not
	  directly associated to any device.

	bool "MediaTek DVFSRC Support"
	depends on ARCH_MEDIATEK
	default ARCH_MEDIATEK
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek DVFSRC (dynamic voltage
	  and frequency scaling resource collector) found
	  on different MediaTek SoCs. The DVFSRC is a proprietary
	  hardware which is used to collect all the requests from
	  system and turn into the decision of minimum Vcore voltage
	  and minimum DRAM frequency to fulfill those requests.

config MTK_PMIC_WRAP
	tristate "MediaTek PMIC Wrapper Support"
	select RESET_CONTROLLER
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for MediaTek PMIC Wrapper found
