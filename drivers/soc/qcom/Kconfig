	help
	  Add support to dump various hardware entities such as the instruction
	  and data tlb's as well as the unified tlb, which are a part of the
	  cpu subsystem to an allocated buffer. This allows for analysis of the
	  the entities if corruption is suspected.
	  If unsure, say N

	depends on ARCH_QCOM && !ARM64
	select ARM_CPU_SUSPEND
	select QCOM_SCM
	help
	  QCOM Platform specific power driver to manage cores and L2 low power
	  modes. It interface with various system drivers to put the cores in
	  low power modes.

config QCOM_SMEM
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Manager (SMEM)"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	depends on HWSPINLOCK
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Manager.
	  The driver provides an interface to items in a heap shared among all
	  processors in a Qualcomm platform.

config QCOM_SMD

	  platforms.

config QCOM_SMD_RPM
	tristate "Qualcomm Resource Power Manager (RPM) over SMD"
	depends on QCOM_SMD && OF
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Resource Power Manager system found in the Qualcomm 8974 based
	  devices.

	  This is required to access many regulators, clocks and bus
	  frequencies controlled by the RPM on these devices.

	  Say M here if you want to include support for the Qualcomm RPM as a
	  module. This will build a module called "qcom-smd-rpm".

config QCOM_SCM
	bool "Secure Channel Manager (SCM) support"
	default n

config QCOM_SMEM_STATE
	bool

config QCOM_SMP2P

	depends on QCOM_SMD
	help
	  Client driver for the WCNSS_CTRL SMD channel, used to download nv
	  firmware to a newly booted WCNSS chip.

config MSM_BOOT_STATS
	bool "Use MSM boot stats reporting"
	help
	  Use this to report msm boot stats such as bootloader throughput,
	  display init, total boot time.
	  This figures are reported in mpm sleep clock cycles and have a
	  resolution of 31 bits as 1 bit is used as an overflow check.

config MSM_CORE_HANG_DETECT
       tristate "MSM Core Hang Detection Support"
       help
         This enables the core hang detection module. It causes SoC
         reset on core hang detection and collects the core context
         for hang.

config MSM_GLADIATOR_HANG_DETECT
       tristate "MSM Gladiator Hang Detection Support"
       help
         This enables the gladiator hang detection module.
         If the configured threshold is reached, it causes SoC reset on
         gladiator hang detection and collects the context for the
         gladiator hang.

config MSM_GLADIATOR_ERP_V2
       tristate "GLADIATOR coherency interconnect error reporting driver v2"
       help
               Support dumping debug information for the GLADIATOR
               cache interconnect in the error interrupt handler.

       bool "Panic on GLADIATOR error report v2"
       help
               Panic upon detection of an Gladiator coherency interconnect error
               in order to support dumping debug information.
               Meant to be used for debug scenarios only.

               If unsure, say N.

config QCOM_WATCHDOG_V2
	bool "Qualcomm Watchdog Support"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	help
	  This enables the watchdog module. It causes kernel panic if the
	  watchdog times out. It allows for detection of cpu hangs and
	  deadlocks. It does not run during the bootup process, so it will
	  not catch any early lockups.

config QCOM_MEMORY_DUMP_V2
	bool "QCOM Memory Dump V2 Support"
	help
	  This enables memory dump feature. It allows various client
	  subsystems to register respective dump regions. At the time
	  of deadlocks or cpu hangs these dump regions are captured to
	  give a snapshot of the system at the time of the crash.
