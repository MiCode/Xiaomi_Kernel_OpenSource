	bool "Debug and ETM trace support across power collapse"
	help
	  Enables support for debugging (specifically breakpoints) and ETM
	  processor tracing across power collapse both for JTag and OS hosted
	  software running on the target. Enabling this will ensure debug
	  and ETM registers are saved and restored across power collapse.

	  If unsure, say 'N' here to avoid potential power, performance and
	  memory penalty.

config MSM_JTAG_MM
	bool "Debug and ETM trace support across power collapse using memory mapped access"
	help
	  Enables support for debugging (specifically breakpoints) and ETM
	  processor tracing across power collapse both for JTag and OS hosted
	  software running on the target. Enabling this will ensure debug
	  and ETM registers are saved and restored across power collapse.

	  Required on targets on which cp14 access to debug and ETM registers is
	  not permitted and so memory mapped access is necessary.

	  If unsure, say 'N' here to avoid potential power, performance and
	  memory penalty.

config MSM_QMI_INTERFACE
	depends on IPC_ROUTER
	depends on QMI_ENCDEC
	bool "MSM QMI Interface Library"

	  inter-processor communication.

config MSM_SMEM_LOGGING
	depends on MSM_SMEM
	bool "MSM Shared Memory Logger"
	help
	  Enable the shared memory logging to log the events between
	  the various processors in the system. This option exposes
	  the shared memory logger at /dev/smem_log and a debugfs node
	  named smem_log.

config MSM_QDSP6_APRV2
	bool "Audio QDSP6 APRv2 support"
	depends on MSM_SMD
	help
	  Enable APRv2 IPC protocol support between
	  application processor and QDSP6. APR is

	  ASM, ADM and AFE.

config MSM_QDSP6_APRV3
	bool "Audio QDSP6 APRv3 support"
	depends on MSM_SMD
	help
	  Enable APRv2 IPC protocol support between
	  application processor and QDSP6. APR is
	  used by audio driver to configure QDSP6v2's
	  ASM, ADM and AFE.

config MSM_ADSP_LOADER
	tristate "ADSP loader support"
	select SND_SOC_MSM_APRV2_INTF
	depends on MSM_QDSP6_APRV2 || MSM_QDSP6_APRV3
	help
	  Enable ADSP image loader.
	  The ADSP loader brings ADSP out of reset
	  for the platforms that use APRv2.
	  Say M if you want to enable this module.

config MSM_MEMORY_DUMP
	bool "MSM Memory Dump Support"
	help
	  This enables memory dump feature. It allows various client
	  subsystems to register respective dump regions. At the time
	  of deadlocks or cpu hangs these dump regions are captured to
	  give a snapshot of the system at the time of the crash.

config MSM_WATCHDOG_V2
	bool "MSM Watchdog Support"
	help
	  This enables the watchdog module. It causes kernel panic if the
	  watchdog times out. It allows for detection of cpu hangs and
	  deadlocks. It does not run during the bootup process, so it will
	  not catch any early lockups.

config MSM_SUBSYSTEM_RESTART
	bool "MSM Subsystem Restart"
	help
	  This option enables the MSM subsystem restart framework.

	  The MSM subsystem restart framework provides support to boot,
	  shutdown, and restart subsystems with a reference counted API.

	  Support for booting and shutting down QDSP6v5 (Hexagon) processors
	  in low power audio subsystems. This driver also monitors the ADSP
	  SMSM status bits and the ADSP's watchdog interrupt and restarts the
	  ADSP if the processor encounters a fatal error.
