config MSM_KERNEL_PROTECT
	bool "Protect kernel text by removing write permissions in stage-2"
        depends on !FUNCTION_TRACER
        help
          On hypervisor-enabled targets, this option will make a call into
          the hypervisor to request that the kernel text be remapped
          without write permissions.  This protects against malicious
          devices rewriting kernel code.

          Note that this will BREAK any runtime patching of the kernel text
          (i.e. anything that uses apply_alternatives,
          aarch64_insn_patch_text_nosync, etc. including the various CPU
          errata workarounds in arch/arm64/kernel/cpu_errata.c).

          Attempts to write to the kernel text after making the kernel text
          read-only.  This test is FATAL whether it passes or fails!
          Success is signaled by a stage-2 fault.

config QCOM_REMOTEQDSS
	bool "Allow debug tools to enable events on other processors"
	depends on QCOM_SCM && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Other onchip processors/execution environments may support debug
	  events. Provide a sysfs interface for debug tools to dynamically
	  enable/disable these events. Interface located in

config MSM_SERVICE_NOTIFIER
	bool "Service Notifier"
	depends on MSM_SERVICE_LOCATOR && MSM_SUBSYSTEM_RESTART
	help
	  The Service Notifier provides a library for a kernel client to
	  register for state change notifications regarding a remote service.
	  A remote service here refers to a process providing certain services
	  like audio, the identifier for which is provided by the service
	  locator.

config MSM_QBT1000
	bool "QBT1000 Ultrasonic Fingerprint Sensor"
	help
	  This driver provides services for configuring the fingerprint
	  sensor hardware and for communicating with the trusted app which
	  uses it. It enables clocks and provides commands for loading
	  trusted apps, unloading them and marshalling buffers to the
	  trusted fingerprint app.

config MSM_RPM_RBCPR_STATS_V2_LOG
	tristate "MSM Resource Power Manager RPBCPR Stat Driver"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This option enables v2 of the rpmrbcpr_stats driver which reads RPM
	  memory for statistics pertaining to RPM's RBCPR(Rapid Bridge Core
	  Power Reduction) driver. The drivers outputs the message via a
	  debugfs node.

config MSM_RPM_LOG
	tristate "MSM Resource Power Manager Log Driver"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	depends on MSM_RPM_SMD
	default n
	help
	  This option enables a driver which can read from a circular buffer
	  of messages produced by the RPM. These messages provide diagnostic
	  information about RPM operation. The driver outputs the messages
	  via a debugfs node.

config MSM_RPM_STATS_LOG
	tristate "MSM Resource Power Manager Stat Driver"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	depends on MSM_RPM_SMD
	default n
	help
	  This option enables a driver which reads RPM messages from a shared
	  memory location. These messages provide statistical information about
	  the low power modes that RPM enters. The drivers outputs the message
	  via a debugfs node.

config QSEE_IPC_IRQ_BRIDGE
	tristate "QSEE IPC Interrupt Bridge"
	help
	  This module enables bridging an Inter-Processor Communication(IPC)
	  interrupt from a remote subsystem directed towards Qualcomm
	  Technologies, Inc. Secure Execution Environment(QSEE).

config WCD_DSP_GLINK
	tristate "WCD DSP GLINK Driver"
	depends on MSM_GLINK
	default y if SND_SOC_WCD934X=y
	help
	   This option enables driver which provides communication interface
	   between MSM and WCD DSP over glink transport protocol. This driver
	   provides read and write interface via char device.

config QCOM_SMCINVOKE
	bool "Secure QSEE Support"
	help
	  Enable SMCInvoke driver which supports capability based secure
	  communication between QSEE and HLOS.

config QCOM_EARLY_RANDOM
	bool "Initialize random pool very early"
	help
	  The standard random pool may not initialize until late in the boot
	  process which means that any calls to get random numbers before then
	  may not be truly random. Select this option to make an early call
	  to get some random data to put in the pool. If unsure, say N.
