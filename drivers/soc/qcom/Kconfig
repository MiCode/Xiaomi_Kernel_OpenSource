	depends on MSM_SMD
	depends on IPC_ROUTER
	bool "MSM SMD XPRT Layer"
	help
	  SMD Transport Layer that enables IPC Router communication within
	  a System-on-Chip(SoC). When the SMD channels become available,
	  this layer registers a transport with IPC Router and enable
	  message exchange.

config MSM_IPC_ROUTER_HSIC_XPRT

	depends on IPC_ROUTER
	bool "MSM HSIC XPRT Layer"
	help
	  HSIC Transport Layer that enables off-chip communication of
	  IPC Router. When the HSIC endpoint becomes available, this layer
	  registers the transport with IPC Router and enable message
	  exchange.

config MSM_SMEM
	depends on REMOTE_SPINLOCK_MSM
	bool "MSM Shared Memory (SMEM)"
	help
	  Support for the shared memory interface between the various
	  processors in the System on a Chip (SoC) which allows basic
	  inter-processor communication.

	bool "Audio QDSP6 APRv2 support"
	depends on MSM_SMD
	help
	  Enable APRv2 IPC protocol support between
	  application processor and QDSP6. APR is
	  used by audio driver to configure QDSP6's
	  ASM, ADM and AFE.

config MSM_QDSP6_APRV3
	bool "Audio QDSP6 APRv3 support"
	depends on MSM_SMD
	help
	  Enable APRv2 IPC protocol support between

	help
	  Enable ADSP image loader.
	  The ADSP loader brings ADSP out of reset
	  for the platforms that use APRv2.
	  Say M if you want to enable this module.
