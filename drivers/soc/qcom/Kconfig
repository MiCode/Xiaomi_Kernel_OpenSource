	  the APIs to the client drivers that wants to send the PBS trigger
	  event to the PBS RAM.

config QTI_PMIC_PON_LOG
	tristate "PMIC PON log parser driver"
	help
	  The PMIC PON log driver parses PMIC power-on, power-off, and fault
	  information out of a binary log stored in the SDAM memory found on
	  some Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. PMIC devices.  This driver is useful
	  when debugging unexpected power-off scenarios.

config MSM_BOOT_STATS
	tristate "Use MSM boot stats reporting"
	help
	  Use this to report msm boot stats such as bootloader throughput,
	  display init, total boot time.
	  This figures are reported in mpm sleep clock cycles and have a
	  resolution of 31 bits as 1 bit is used as an overflow check.

config USB_BAM
	tristate "USB BAM Driver"
	help
	  Enabling this option adds USB BAM Driver.
	  USB BAM driver was added to supports Smart Peripheral Subsystem
	  Peripheral-to-Peripheral transfers between the USB and other
	  peripheral.

config QCOM_RAMDUMP
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Ramdump driver"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables the QTI ramdump driver. The ramdump driver
	  provides APIs to collect ramdumps which can be extracted from
	  userspace. Say 'Y' here to enable this driver. It's safe to say
	  'N' here if you don't plan on collecting ramdumps.

config QCOM_CPU_VENDOR_HOOKS
        tristate "QTI Vendor Hooks Support"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM && ANDROID_VENDOR_HOOKS
        help
          CPU vendor hooks driver registers with andriod vendor hooks
          provided by core kernel to extend kernel functionality.

          Currently these features are not supported by upstream kernel and not
          having scope to upstream.
          If unsure, say N.

config QCOM_PANEL_EVENT_NOTIFIER
	tristate "panel event notifier"
	depends on DRM
	help
	Enabling this option adds panel event notifier driver.
	This driver is responsible for notifying clients interested in display
	panel events such as panel on , panel off, fps change etc.  Clients
	can use these notifications for power saving or align its operations
	with display panel power state.

config QCOM_MEM_OFFLINE
	tristate "Dynamic Memory Region Offline driver"
	depends on MEMORY_HOTPLUG
	help
	  Add support for DDR Self-Refresh power management through the dynamic
	  memory offline framework. This driver interfaces between the memory
	  hotplug subsystem and AOP which hot adds or removes memory blocks and
	  controls the start/stop of self-refresh of these DDR regions. This
	  helps reduce power consumption during idle mode of the system.
	  If unsure, say N

config BUG_ON_HW_MEM_ONLINE_FAIL
	bool "Trigger a BUG when HW memory online fails"
	depends on QCOM_MEM_OFFLINE
	help
	  Select this option if kernel should BUG when the hardware
	  onlining of memory hotplug blocks fails. This helps to catch
	  online failures much quicker and avoids the later side effects
	  of such memory online failures.
	  If unsure, say N

config QCOM_GUESTVM
        tristate "Enable Guest VM to be loaded by PIL"
        select QCOM_MDT_LOADER
        help
           This driver invokes Peripheral Image Loader to load images of
           any guest Virtual Machine (VM). It also communicates with the
           Resource Manager driver to start the boot of VMs once it has
           successfully loaded the VM images in the designated memory.

config QCOM_HYP_CORE_CTL
        tristate "CPU reservation scheme for Hypervisor"
        depends on QCOM_GUESTVM && SCHED_WALT
        help
          This driver reserve the specified CPUS by isolating them. The reserved
          CPUs can be assigned to the other guest OS by the hypervisor.
          An offline CPU is considered as a reserved CPU since this OS can't use
          it.

config QCOM_FSA4480_I2C
	tristate "Fairchild FSA4480 chip with I2C"
	select REGMAP_I2C
	depends on I2C
	help
	  Support for the Fairchild FSA4480 IC switch chip controlled
	  using I2C. This driver provides common support
	  for accessing the device, switching between USB and Audio
	  modes, changing orientation.

config GH_TLMM_VM_MEM_ACCESS

        help
         Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. TLMM VM mem access driver for MSM devices.
         The drivers provides initial gpio memory access to VM.
         Say Y here to compile the driver as a part of kernel or M to compile
         as a module.
