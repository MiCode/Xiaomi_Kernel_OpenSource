	  Add support for the Peripheral Access Control Manager (PACMan). This

	  peripheral (BLSP) ownership.

        depends on !FUNCTION_TRACER
        help
          On hypervisor-enabled targets, this option will make a call into
          the hypervisor to request that the kernel text be remapped
          without write permissions.  This protects against malicious
          devices rewriting kernel code.

          Note that this will BREAK any runtime patching of the kernel text
          (i.e. anything that uses apply_alternatives,
          aarch64_insn_patch_text_nosync, etc. including the various CPU
          errata workarounds in arch/arm64/kernel/cpu_errata.c).

          Attempts to write to the kernel text after making the kernel text
          read-only.  This test is FATAL whether it passes or fails!
          Success is signaled by a stage-2 fault.
