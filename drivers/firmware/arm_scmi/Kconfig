	help
	  ARM System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) protocol is a
	  set of operating system-independent software interfaces that are
	  used in system management. SCMI is extensible and currently provides
	  interfaces for: Discovery and self-description of the interfaces
	  it supports, Power domain management which is the ability to place
	  a given device or domain into the various power-saving states that
	  it supports, Performance management which is the ability to control
	  the performance of a domain that is composed of compute engines
	  such as application processors and other accelerators, Clock
	  management which is the ability to set and inquire rates on platform
	  managed clocks and Sensor management which is the ability to read
	  sensor data, and be notified of sensor value.

	  This protocol library provides interface for all the client drivers
	  making use of the features offered by the SCMI.

	bool
	help
	  This declares whether at least one SCMI transport has been configured.
	  Used to trigger a build bug when trying to build SCMI without any
	  configured transport.

config ARM_SCMI_HAVE_SHMEM
	bool
	help
	  This declares whether a shared memory based transport for SCMI is
	  available.

config ARM_SCMI_HAVE_MSG
	bool

	  Enable mailbox based transport for SCMI.

	  If you want the ARM SCMI PROTOCOL stack to include support for a
	  transport based on mailboxes, answer Y.

          System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) pmu vendor protocol.
          This protocol provides interface to communicate with micro controller
          which maintains the PMU configuration for multiple clients.

          This driver defines the comands or message ID's used for this
          communication and also exposes the ops used by clients.

	  This enables support for the SCMI power domains which can be
	  enabled or disabled via the SCP firmware

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called scmi_pm_domain. Note this may needed early in boot
	  before rootfs may be available.
