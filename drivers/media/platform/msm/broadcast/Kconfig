config TSPP
	depends on ARCH_MSM
	tristate "TSPP (Transport Stream Packet Processor) Support"
	---help---
	Transport Stream Packet Processor v1 is used to offload the
	processing of MPEG transport streams from the main processor.
	It is used to process incoming transport streams from TSIF
	to supports use-cases such as transport stream live play
	and recording.
	This can also be compiled as a loadable module.

config TSPP2

	tristate "TSPP2 (Transport Stream Packet Processor v2) Support"
	---help---
	Transport Stream Packet Processor v2 is used to offload the
	processing of MPEG transport streams from the main processor.
	It is used to process incoming transport streams from TSIF or memory
	input, to supports use-cases such as transport stream live play,
	playback from memory and recording.
	This can also be compiled as a loadable module.

config CI_BRIDGE_SPI
	depends on SPI_QUP
	tristate "CI Bridge SPI Driver Support"
	---help---
	This driver provides a simple SPI read/write interface to
	an external CI bridge. It implements a character device
	driver interface which allows making SPI transactions
	using the Linux SPI framework.

	To compile this driver as module, choose M here.
