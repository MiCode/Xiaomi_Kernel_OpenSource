config NET_VENDOR_MSM
	bool "MSM network devices"

	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about MSM network controllers. If you say Y, you will
	  be asked for your specific controller in the following questions.
