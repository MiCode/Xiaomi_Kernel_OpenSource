config NVMAP_PAGE_POOLS
	bool "Use page pools to reduce allocation overhead"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  say Y here to reduce the alloction overhead, which is significant
	  for uncached, writecombine and inner cacheable memories as it
	  involves changing page attributes during every allocation per page
	  and flushing cache. Alloc time is reduced by allcoating the pages
	  ahead and keeping them aside. The reserved pages would be released
	  when system is low on memory and acquired back during release of
	  memory.

	  Say Y here to fill up the page pools during page pool init time.
	  This helps in faster alloctions right from the early alloction

	 Say Y here to reduce cache maintenance overhead by MVA.
	 This helps in reducing cache maintenance overhead in the systems,
	 where inner cache includes only L1. For the systems, where inner cache
	 includes L1 and L2, keep this option disabled.

config NVMAP_CACHE_MAINT_BY_SET_WAYS_ON_ONE_CPU

	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP && NVMAP_CACHE_MAINT_BY_SET_WAYS

	  Say Y here to avoid cache maint on all CPU's during inner cache maint
	  by set/ways. When L1 and L2 are inner caches, cache maint on one
	  CPU is enough. When L1 is inner and L2 is outer, cache maint on
	  all CPU's is necessary during L1 cache maint by set/ways.

config NVMAP_OUTER_CACHE_MAINT_BY_SET_WAYS
	bool "Enable outer cache maintenance by set/ways"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP

config NVMAP_DEFERRED_CACHE_MAINT
	bool "Enable deferred cache maintenance"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to defer flush requests for
	  nvmap memory buffer. Cache maintenance of deferred requests
	  is more efficient since there is a high chance that cache lines
	  of earlier requests are already flushed. Also, if total size of
	  deferred ranges is big enough, we flush whole inner or outer
	  cache.

config NVMAP_DMABUF_STASH

	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  Set to Y if you would like nvmap to stash maps when using dma
	  bufs. This will speed up remapping of the same handle at the cost
	  of using more IOVA space.

config NVMAP_DMABUF_STASH_STATS
	bool "Enable stat tracking on the stash"
	depends on NVMAP_DMABUF_STASH
	help
	  Say Y to enable tracking of basic cache statistics on the dmabuf
	  stash. This adds some overhead but should be very useful for
	  debugging memory leaks.

config NVMAP_VPR

	  Say Y here to enable Video Protection Region(VPR) heap.

config NVMAP_FORCE_ZEROED_USER_PAGES
	bool "Only alloc zeroed pages for user space"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	help
	  Say Y here to force zeroing of pages allocated for user space. This
	  avoids leaking kernel secure data to user space. This can add
	  significant overhead to allocation operations depending on the
	  allocation size requested.

config NVMAP_USE_FD_FOR_HANDLE

	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to use Fd's for representing NvMap handles
	  in user space. Enabling this config returns DmaBuf
	  compatible Fd's to user space during handle creation
	  requests. The kernel component that receives these Fd's
	  can use either NvMap interface or DmaBuf interface in order
	  to access NvMap handle memory.

config NVMAP_USE_CMA_FOR_CARVEOUT
	bool "Use CMA memory for carveouts"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	help
	  Say Y here to reserve carveout memory using CMA
	  API. CMA reserved memory can be used by applications
	  when it is not in use by the device that reserved it.

config NVMAP_CPA
	bool "Use CPA API in nvmap"
	depends on CPA
	help
	  Say Y here to have nvmap use CPA. CPA is necessary for
	  certain chips where page table aliasing can cause undefined
	  results due to speculative memory loads/stores. If unsure,
	  say N.

	  I/O virtual memory requests.

config NVMAP_HANDLE_MARSHAL
	bool "Marshal nvmap handle id"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	help
	  Enables nvmap handle id marshalling. Marshalling converts
	  the nvmap handle id into an unique number before passing
	  the handle id to user/kernel clients. The marshalling
	  would allow sharing a 64-bit handle id as 32-bit id to
	  user space when kernel is 64-bit and user space is 32-bit.

config TEGRA_NVHDCP
	bool "Support NVHDCP content protection on HDMI"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to support NVHDCP upstream and downstream protocols, this
	  requires a correctly fused chip to negotiate keys.

config TEGRA_HDMI_74MHZ_LIMIT
	bool "Support only up to 74.25 MHz HDMI pixel frequency"
	default n
