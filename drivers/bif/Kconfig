	  MIPI-BIF (battery interface) is a one-wire serial interface between a
	  host master device and one or more slave devices which are located in
	  a battery pack or also on the host.  Enabling this option allows for
	  BIF consumer drivers to issue transactions via BIF controller drivers.

	  This driver supports the QPNP BSI peripheral found inside of Qualcomm
	  QPNP PMIC devices.  The BSI peripheral is able to communicate using
	  the BIF protocol.  The QPNP BSI driver hooks into the BIF framework.
	  Enable this option in order to provide support for BIF communication
	  on targets which have BSI PMIC peripherals.
