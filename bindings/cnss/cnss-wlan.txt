* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. ConNectivity SubSystem Platform Driver

This platform driver adds support for the CNSS subsystem used for PCIe
based Wi-Fi devices. It also adds support to integrate PCIe WLAN module
to subsystem restart framework. Apart from that, it also manages the
3.3V voltage regulator, WLAN Enable GPIO signal and PCIe link dynamically
with support for suspend and resume by retaining the PCI config space
states when PCIe link is shutdown. The main purpose of this device tree
entry below is to invoke the CNSS platform driver and provide handle to
the WLAN enable GPIO, 3.3V fixed voltage regulator resources. It also
provides the reserved RAM dump memory location and size.
