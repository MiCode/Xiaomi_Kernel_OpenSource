QTI PMU Driver

This driver provides an interface to request for per-CPU performance counters
that are available on some Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI) chipsets.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,pmu"
- qcom,pmu-events-tbl:	A list of the pmu events to be configured on the cpus.
			The first column in the table contains the event id and
			the second column contains the a bit mask (cpumask) of
			cpus for which the event should be configured on.

Example:

	qcom,pmu {
		compatible = "qcom,pmu";
		qcom,pmu-events-tbl =
			< 0x0008 0xFF >,
			< 0x0011 0xFF >,
			< 0x0017 0xFF >,
			< 0x002A 0xFF >,
			< 0x1000 0xFF >;
	};
